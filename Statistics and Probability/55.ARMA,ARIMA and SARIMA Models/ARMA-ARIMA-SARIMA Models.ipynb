    "## ARMA, ARIMA and SARIMA Models\n",
    "\n",
    "ARMA, ARIMA, and SARIMA are models commonly used to analyze and forecast time series data. ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average) combines two ideas: using past values to predict current ones (**autoregression**) and smoothing out noise using past forecast errors (**moving average**). ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) builds on ARMA by adding a step to handle trends in non-stationary data through differencing. SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) takes it a step further by accounting for repeating seasonal patterns. These models are practical and versatile for working with time series data that show trends, noise, or seasonal effects.\n",

    "### Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) Models\n",
    "\n",
    "ARMA models combine autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components to model time series data exhibiting both autocorrelation and serial dependence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Definition of ARMA Models\n",
    "\n",
    "An **ARMA($p, q$)** model is defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X_t = c + \\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\phi_i X_{t-i} + \\epsilon_t + \\sum_{j=1}^{q} \\theta_j \\epsilon_{t-j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or, equivalently, using the backshift operator $B$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi(B) X_t = c + \\theta(B) \\epsilon_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Stationarity of AR Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "An AR($p$) process is **stationary** if all the roots of the characteristic polynomial $\\phi(B) = 0$ lie outside the unit circle in the complex plane. This condition ensures that the time series has a constant mean and variance over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Invertibility of MA Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "An MA($q$) process is **invertible** if all the roots of $\\theta(B) = 0$ lie outside the unit circle. Invertibility allows the MA process to be expressed as an infinite AR process, ensuring a unique representation and facilitating parameter estimation.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The **autoregressive (AR) polynomial**, represented as $\\phi_p(B)$, captures the influence of past values on the current value.  \n",
    "- The **differencing order**, $d$, represents the number of times the series is differenced to achieve stationarity.  \n",
    "- The **moving average (MA) polynomial**, $\\theta_q(B)$, models the impact of past forecast errors on the current value.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Consider a time series consisting of monthly airline passenger data. This particular time series is characterized by two distinct features: an upward trend indicating an increase in the number of passengers over time, and a seasonal pattern that repeats every 12 months, typically linked to factors such as holiday travel or seasonal tourism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Model and Forecast the Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "I. Decompose the Time Series into Trend, Seasonal, and Residual Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time series decomposition methods such as classical decomposition and STL decomposition can be applied to analyze the structure of a time series.  \n",
    "- The decomposition process breaks down the original time series into three distinct components to enhance interpretability.  \n",
    "- The **trend component** reveals the long-term direction of the data, indicating whether it is increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable over time.  \n",
    "- The **seasonal component** highlights periodic patterns in the data, occurring at consistent intervals such as months, quarters, or years.  \n",
    "- The **residual component** accounts for random fluctuations or noise that are not explained by the trend or seasonal patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "II. Detrend the Time Series Using Differencing or Transformation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Methods such as logarithmic transformation and differencing are useful for stabilizing the mean and variance of a time series.  \n",
    "- **Differencing** involves subtracting the current value from the previous value, which helps remove trends and make the series stationary. Seasonal differencing adjusts for periodic patterns by subtracting the value from the same period in the previous cycle.  \n",
    "- **Transformations** like logarithmic, square root, or Box-Cox are applied to stabilize variance and reduce heteroscedasticity in the time series. These techniques make it easier to model and analyze the data effectively.\n",
    "  \n",
    "III. Fit an Appropriate Model that Accounts for Both Trend and Seasonality:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Models such as Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) and Exponential Smoothing State Space Model (ETS) are effective for forecasting time series data with seasonal patterns.  \n",
    "- **SARIMA** extends the ARIMA model by incorporating seasonal terms, making it suitable for data with repeating seasonal behavior. It is defined by the parameters (p, d, q) for the non-seasonal part and (P, D, Q)s for the seasonal part, where \"s\" represents the seasonal frequency.  \n",
    "- **ETS** combines error, trend, and seasonal components, making it useful for handling time series with stable seasonal patterns. It adapts to variations in the data and is flexible in modeling additive or multiplicative effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "IV. Forecast Future Values Using the Fitted Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the model to forecast future values.\n",
    "- This step involves generating predictions based on the model's understanding of the trend and seasonal patterns in the historical data.\n",
    "- Ensure to provide confidence intervals for these predictions to understand the potential variability in the forecasts.\n",

    "- The **original data** is presented in blue, and the trend component is shown in orange, allowing for a clear visualization of long-term trends over time.  \n",
