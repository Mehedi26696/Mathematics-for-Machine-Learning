    "## Geometric Distribution (Discrete)\n",
    "\n",
    "A discrete random variable X follows a geometric distribution if it represents the number of trials needed to get the first success in a sequence of Bernoulli trials. The geometric distribution is denoted as $X \\sim \\text{Geometric}(p)$, where p is the probability of success on each trial.\n",

    "### Probability Mass Function (PMF)\n",
    "\n",
    "The PMF of a geometric distribution is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(X=k) = (1-p)^{k-1} p$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$, representing the number of trials until the first success.\n",

    "The CDF of a geometric distribution is given by:\n",

    "\n",
    "The expected value (mean) of a geometric distribution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[X] = \\frac{1}{p}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance of a geometric distribution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Var}(X) = \\frac{1-p}{p^2}$$\n",

    "### Moment Generating Function (MGF)\n",
    "\n",
    "The moment generating function (MGF) of a geometric distribution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$M_X(t) = \\frac{pe^t}{1 - (1 - p)e^t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Flipping a Coin\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider flipping a fair coin (probability of heads `p = 0.5`) until the first head appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "I. What is the probability that the first head appears on the 3rd flip?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first head on the 3rd flip:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(X = 3) = (1-0.5)^{3-1} \\times 0.5 = 0.125$$\n",
    "\n",
    "II. What is the expected number of flips to get the first head?\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected number of flips:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[X] = \\frac{1}{0.5} = 2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "III. What is the variance in the number of flips?\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance in the number of flips:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Var}(X) = \\frac{1-0.5}{0.5^2} = 2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometric distributions are useful in scenarios where you are waiting for the first success in a series of independent trials, such as in quality control testing, network packet delivery analysis, and reliability testing in engineering.\n"
