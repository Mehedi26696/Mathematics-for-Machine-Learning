    "## Autocovariance functions and coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "Autocovariance functions describe how values of a time series relate to their lagged counterparts, measuring the joint variability between a series at time $t$ and its value at a previous time $t-k$ (where $k$ is the lag). In autoregressive models, these relationships are expressed through **coefficients**, which quantify the influence of past values on future values. The autocovariance function helps in estimating these coefficients by analyzing the strength and pattern of correlations at different lags. Higher autocovariance at a specific lag suggests a stronger influence of past values on the present, aiding in model selection and parameter estimation for time series models like AR, MA, and ARIMA.\n",

    "\n",
    "A **random variable (r.v.)** is a mapping from a set of outcomes in a probability space to a set of real numbers. We can distinguish between:\n",
    "\n",
    "I. **Discrete random variables** take on countable values. For example, let:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X = \\{45, 36, 27, \\dots\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "II. **Continuous random variables** take on any value in a continuous range. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y \\in (10, 60)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A **realization** is a specific observed value of a random variable. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X = 20 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad Y = 30.29\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Covariance\n",
    "\n",
    "The **covariance** between two random variables $X$ and $Y$ measures the linear relationship between them. It is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Cov}(X, Y) = E\\left[(X - \\mu_X)(Y - \\mu_Y)\\right]\n",

    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $\\text{Cov}(X, Y) > 0$, $X$ and $Y$ increase together.\n",
    "- If $\\text{Cov}(X, Y) < 0$, when $X$ increases, $Y$ tends to decrease.\n",
    "- If $\\text{Cov}(X, Y) = 0$, there is no linear dependence between $X$ and $Y$.\n",

    "#### Estimation of Covariance\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the covariance from a paired dataset $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\dots, (x_N, y_N)$, we use the sample covariance formula:\n",

    "### Stochastic Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "A **stochastic process** is a collection of random variables indexed by time, denoted as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\{X_t : t \\in T\\}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "**Variance** as a special case:\n",
    "\n",
    "When $s = t$, the autocovariance function simplifies to the variance of the series at time $t$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\gamma(t, t) = E\\left[(X_t - \\mu_t)^2\\right] = \\text{Var}(X_t) = \\sigma_t^2\n",

    "### Lagged Autocovariance\n",
    "\n",
    "The **lagged autocovariance function** measures the covariance between values of the series at times $t$ and $t+k$, where $k$ is the lag:\n",

    "\\gamma_k = \\gamma(t, t+k) = E\\left[(X_t - \\mu)(X_{t+k} - \\mu)\\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a **stationary process**, the autocovariance function depends only on the lag $k$, not the specific times $t$ and $t+k$:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\gamma_k \\approx c_k\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that the autocovariance function remains constant for different time points, provided the lag $k$ is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Autocovariance Coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "**Autocovariance** measures the covariance of a time series with itself at different time lags. For a time series $\\{X_t\\}$, the **autocovariance at lag $k$** is defined as:\n",

    "#### Assumption of Weak Stationarity\n",
    "\n",
    "For weakly stationary processes, the mean $\\mu$ is constant, and the autocovariance $\\gamma_k$ depends only on the lag $k$, not on the actual time points $t$ and $t+k$. Therefore, the autocovariance function becomes:\n",
