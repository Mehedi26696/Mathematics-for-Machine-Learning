    "## Difference Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "A **difference equation** (also known as a recurrence relation) defines each term of a sequence based on previous terms. In some cases, the general term of a sequence is given explicitly (e.g., $a_n = 3n + 2$, resulting in the sequence $5, 8, 11, \\dots$). However, more commonly, a difference equation provides a relationship between terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a_n = 4 a_{n-1} - 5 a_{n-2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is a second-order difference equation because it relates $a_n$ to the two previous terms $a_{n-1}$ and $a_{n-2}$.\n",

    "### Solving Difference Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve a difference equation, we often look for a solution of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a_n = \\lambda^n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumes a solution structure where each term is proportional to the previous term by some factor $\\lambda$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the difference equation:\n",

    "\\lambda^n = 4 \\lambda^{n-1} - 5 \\lambda^{n-2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Dividing both sides by $\\lambda^{n-2}$, we get the **characteristic equation**:\n",
