    "# Geostatistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Geostatistics is a branch of statistics that focuses on the analysis and interpretation of spatial or spatiotemporal datasets. It is widely used in fields such as geology, hydrology, environmental science, agriculture, and meteorology. Geostatistics provides tools for modeling spatial correlation, predicting values at unsampled locations, and quantifying the uncertainty associated with these predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fundamental Concepts in Geostatistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Geostatistics is built upon several key mathematical and statistical concepts essential for understanding and modeling spatial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Spatial Autocorrelation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spatial autocorrelation** refers to the correlation of a variable with itself across space. It quantifies the degree to which observations at spatial locations are similar to one another. According to Tobler's First Law of Geography:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, spatial autocorrelation is assessed through statistics like **Moran's I** and **Geary's C**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Moran's I** measures global spatial autocorrelation:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  I = \\frac{n}{W} \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{n} w_{ij}(Z_i - \\bar{Z})(Z_j - \\bar{Z})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Z_i - \\bar{Z})^2}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  Where:\n",
    "  - $n $ is the number of observations.\n",
    "  - $Z_i $ and $Z_j $ are the values at locations $i $ and $j $.\n",
    "  - $\\bar{Z} $ is the mean of $Z $.\n",
    "  - $w_{ij} $ is the spatial weight between locations $i $ and $j $.\n",
    "  - $W = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{n} w_{ij} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Geary's C** focuses on local spatial autocorrelation:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  C = \\frac{(n - 1)}{2W} \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{n} w_{ij}(Z_i - Z_j)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Z_i - \\bar{Z})^2}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Values of Moran's I range from -1 (perfect dispersion) to +1 (perfect correlation), with 0 indicating random spatial patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Variogram and Covariance Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The **variogram** and **covariance function** are fundamental tools used to quantify spatial dependence in geostatistics.\n",

    "- **Covariance Function ($C(h) $)**: Describes how the covariance between values changes with distance:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  C(h) = \\operatorname{Cov}[Z(x), Z(x + h)] = \\mathbb{E}[(Z(x) - \\mu)(Z(x + h) - \\mu)]\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Variogram Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nugget ($c_0 $)**: Represents measurement error or microscale variation at distances smaller than the sampling interval. It is the variogram value as $h $ approaches zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sill ($c_0 + c $)**: The plateau of the variogram, representing the total variance where spatial dependence levels off.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Range ($a $)**: The distance at which the variogram reaches the sill. Beyond this distance, spatial correlation becomes negligible.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Kriging** is a geostatistical interpolation technique that provides the best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) for spatial data. It leverages the spatial autocorrelation quantified by the variogram to estimate values at unsampled locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kriging Estimator\n",

    "- $\\lambda_i $ are the weights assigned to each observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kriging Weights Determination\n",
    "\n",
    "Weights $\\lambda_i $ are calculated by minimizing the estimation variance $\\operatorname{Var}[Z^*(x_0) - Z(x_0)] $ subject to the unbiasedness condition $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\lambda_i = 1 $. This involves solving a system of linear equations derived from the variogram model.\n",
