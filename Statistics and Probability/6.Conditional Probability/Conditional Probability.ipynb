    "## Conditional Probability and Multiplication Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditional Probability** is the likelihood of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. It is denoted as $P(A|B)$, representing the probability of event $A$ happening, assuming event $B$ has already taken place. This concept is crucial in understanding dependent events in probability theory. The **Multiplication Rule** uses conditional probability to calculate the probability of the intersection of two events. For dependent events, it is written as $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B) \\times P(B)$. If the events are independent, it simplifies to $P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\times P(B)$, as $P(A|B) = P(A)$ in this case. This rule helps in determining joint probabilities of multiple events.\n",

    "#### Dice Example: At Least One Six in Three Rolls\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider rolling a fair six-sided die three times, and let $A$, $B$, and $C$ represent the events of rolling a six on the first, second, and third rolls, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Calculate the Complementary Probability**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The probability of rolling a six on any roll is $P(A) = P(B) = P(C) = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n",
    "- The probability of **not** rolling a six on any roll is $P(A^c) = P(B^c) = P(C^c) = \\frac{5}{6}$.\n",
    "- The probability of **not** rolling a six in any of the three rolls is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A^c \\cap B^c \\cap C^c) = \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^3 = \\frac{125}{216}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Calculate the Probability of Rolling at Least One Six**\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of rolling at least one six in the three rolls is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A \\cup B \\cup C) = 1 - \\frac{125}{216} = \\frac{91}{216} \\approx 0.4213\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the probability of rolling at least one six in three rolls is approximately $0.4213$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates the use of the **Multiplication Rule** for independent events, **Axiom 2 (Normalization)** to ensure the total probability is 1, and **Axiom 1 (Non-Negativity)** to ensure all probabilities are non-negative.\n",

    "### The Birthday Paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "The birthday paradox refers to the surprising probability that in a group of randomly chosen people, at least two will share the same birthday. The intuition might suggest that this probability is low for small groups, but in fact, it's much higher than one might expect. To understand this better, we calculate the complementary probability — the probability that **all** people in the group have **different birthdays**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are 365 days in a year.\n",
    "- We ignore leap years for simplicity.\n",
    "- Birthdays are uniformly distributed, meaning each day is equally likely to be a birthday.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the probability that at least two people share a birthday, we use the complement of the event where all $n$ people have different birthdays. That is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{at least one shared birthday}) = 1 - P(\\text{all birthdays different})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For Two People\n",
    "\n",
    "For two people, the probability that they **do not** share the same birthday is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(B_2) = \\frac{364}{365}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the probability that the second person chooses a different birthday from the first person.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the probability that **at least two people share the same birthday** is the complement:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{at least one shared birthday for 2 people}) = 1 - P(B_2) = 1 - \\frac{364}{365} \\approx 0.00274\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the probability is approximately 0.27% for two people.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For Three People\n",
    "\n",
    "For three people, we first calculate the probability that all three have different birthdays:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(B_3) = \\frac{364}{365} \\times \\frac{363}{365}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The second person avoids the first person's birthday, and the third person avoids the birthdays of the first two people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the probability that at least two people share the same birthday is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{at least one shared birthday for 3 people}) = 1 - P(B_3) = 1 - \\frac{364}{365} \\times \\frac{363}{365} \\approx 1 - 0.9918 = 0.0082\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives a probability of approximately 0.82%.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For Four People\n",
    "\n",
    "For four people, the probability that all four have different birthdays is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(B_4) = \\frac{364}{365} \\times \\frac{363}{365} \\times \\frac{362}{365}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth person avoids the birthdays of the first three.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the probability that at least two people share the same birthday is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{at least one shared birthday for 4 people}) = 1 - P(B_4) = 1 - \\frac{364}{365} \\times \\frac{363}{365} \\times \\frac{362}{365} \\approx 1 - 0.9836 = 0.0164\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives a probability of approximately 1.64%.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Case for $n$ People\n",
    "\n",
    "For $n$ people, we generalize this approach. The probability that all $n$ people have different birthdays is calculated by successively multiplying the probabilities that each additional person has a different birthday, given that the previous people have already chosen different birthdays.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the $n$-th person, the probability that they have a different birthday from the previous $n-1$ people, given that the first $n-1$ people have different birthdays, is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A_n | B_{n-1}) = 1 - \\frac{n-1}{365} = \\frac{365 - (n-1)}{365}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the overall probability that all $n$ people have different birthdays is the product of all these conditional probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(B_n) = P(A_n | B_{n-1}) \\times P(A_{n-1} | B_{n-2}) \\times \\cdots \\times P(A_3 | B_2) \\times P(B_2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This product simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(B_n) = \\frac{365}{365} \\times \\frac{364}{365} \\times \\frac{363}{365} \\times \\cdots \\times \\frac{365 - (n-1)}{365}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the probability that at least two people share a birthday is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{at least one shared birthday for } n \\text{ people}) = 1 - P(B_n)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's calculate the probabilities for small group sizes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2 people**: $P(\\text{at least one shared birthday}) \\approx 0.00274$ (0.27%)\n",
    "- **3 people**: $P(\\text{at least one shared birthday}) \\approx 0.0082$ (0.82%)\n",
    "- **4 people**: $P(\\text{at least one shared birthday}) \\approx 0.0164$ (1.64%)\n",
    "- **5 people**: $P(\\text{at least one shared birthday}) \\approx 0.027$ (2.7%)\n",
    "- **10 people**: $P(\\text{at least one shared birthday}) \\approx 0.117$ (11.7%)\n",
    "- **23 people**: $P(\\text{at least one shared birthday}) \\approx 0.507$ (50.7%)\n",
    "- **30 people**: $P(\\text{at least one shared birthday}) \\approx 0.706$ (70.6%)\n",
    "- **50 people**: $P(\\text{at least one shared birthday}) \\approx 0.97$ (97%)\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the visualization of the probability that at least two people share the same birthday as the group size increases. The red dashed line indicates the 50% probability mark, which occurs at around 23 people:\n",
