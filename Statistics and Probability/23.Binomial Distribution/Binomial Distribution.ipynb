    "## Binomial Distribution (Discrete)\n",
    "\n",
    "A discrete random variable X follows a binomial distribution if it represents the number of successes in a fixed number of Bernoulli trials with the same probability of success. The binomial distribution is denoted as $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p)$, where n is the number of trials and p is the probability of success.\n",

    "### Probability Mass Function (PMF)\n",
    "\n",
    "The PMF of a binomial distribution is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$ and $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ is the binomial coefficient.\n",

    "The CDF of a binomial distribution is given by:\n",

    "$$M_X(t) = E[e^{tX}] = (pe^t + 1 - p)^n$$\n",

    "To find the n-th moment, we take the n-th derivative of the MGF with respect to t and then evaluate it at t=0:\n",

    "### Example: Company Email Security\n",
    "\n",
    "A company's IT department reports that 90% of their employees follow proper email security protocols. If 10 employees are randomly chosen for an audit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Probability of success (following protocol) `p = 0.9`\n",
    "- Number of trials (employees chosen) `n = 10`\n",
    "\n",
    "I. What is the probability exactly 7 of them follow the security protocols?\n",
    "\n",
    "For exactly 7 employees:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(X = 7) = \\binom{10}{7} (0.9)^7 (0.1)^{10-7} = 0.0574$$\n",

    "II. What is the probability at least 8 of them follow the security protocols?\n",
    "\n",
    "For at least 8 employees:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(X \\geq 8) = \\sum_{k=8}^{10} \\binom{10}{k} (0.9)^k (0.1)^{10-k} = 0.9298$$\n",
    "\n",
    "III. What is the probability fewer than 5 employees follow the protocols?\n",
    "\n",
    "For fewer than 5 employees:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(X < 5) = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{10}{k} (0.9)^k (0.1)^{10-k} = 0.0001$$\n",

    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Binomial distributions are used in a variety of applications, such as quality control, risk analysis, and survey sampling, where the probability of success and the number of trials are known or can be estimated.\n"
