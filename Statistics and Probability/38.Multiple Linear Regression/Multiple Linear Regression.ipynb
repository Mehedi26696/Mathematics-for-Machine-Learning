    "# Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a single dependent variable and two or more independent variables. It extends the concept of simple linear regression by incorporating multiple predictors to explain the variability in the dependent variable. This method is widely used in fields such as economics, engineering, social sciences, and natural sciences to predict outcomes and understand the impact of various factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Multiple Linear Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The general form of the multiple linear regression model is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_p x_p + \\varepsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $y$ is the dependent variable (response variable).\n",
    "- $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_p $ are the independent variables (predictor variables).\n",
    "- $\\beta_0 $ is the intercept term (the expected value of $y$ when all $x_j = 0 $).\n",
    "- $\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\dots, \\beta_p $ are the coefficients representing the change in $y$ for a one-unit change in $x_j $, holding all other variables constant.\n",
    "- $\\varepsilon $ is the random error term, accounting for the variability in $y$ not explained by the linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "In matrix notation, the model can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{y}$ is an $n \\times 1$ vector of observations of the dependent variable.\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{X}$ is an $n \\times (p+1)$ matrix of independent variables, including a column of ones for the intercept.\n",
    "- $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is a $(p+1) \\times 1$ vector of coefficients.\n",
    "- $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ is an $n \\times 1$ vector of error terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions of the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "For the multiple linear regression model to provide valid results, several key assumptions must be met:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linearity** means that the relationship between the dependent variable and each independent variable is linear.\n",
    "2. **Independence** assumes that the observations are independent of one another.\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity** ensures that the variance of the error terms remains constant across all levels of the independent variables.\n",
    "4. **Normality** requires that the error terms are normally distributed with a mean of zero.\n",
    "5. Finally, **no multicollinearity** ensures that the independent variables are not perfectly correlated with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Estimation of Coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "### Least Squares Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ are estimated using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method, which minimizes the sum of squared residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values of $y$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to find $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = \\underset{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}{\\text{argmin}} \\, (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^\\top (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution Using Matrix Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "By taking the derivative of the sum of squared residuals with respect to $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ and setting it to zero, we obtain the normal equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{X} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = \\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{y}\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditions for Invertibility**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The matrix $\\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{X}$ must be invertible.\n",
    "- This requires that the columns of $\\mathbf{X}$ are linearly independent (no perfect multicollinearity).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpretation of Coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **intercept ($\\hat{\\beta}_0$)** represents the expected value of $y$ when all independent variables are zero.\n",
    "- The **slope coefficients ($\\hat{\\beta}_j$)** indicate the expected change in $y$ for a one-unit increase in $x_j$, while holding all other variables constant.\n",

    "\n",
