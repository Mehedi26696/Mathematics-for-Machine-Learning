    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation metrics are essential tools for assessing the performance of statistical and machine learning models. They provide quantitative measures that help us understand how well a model is performing and where improvements can be made. In both classification and regression tasks, selecting appropriate evaluation metrics is crucial for model selection, tuning, and validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "In classification tasks, the goal is to assign input data into predefined categories or classes. Evaluating classification models requires metrics that capture the correctness and reliability of the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confusion Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "A **confusion matrix** is a tabular representation of the performance of a classification model. It compares the actual target values with those predicted by the model, providing a breakdown of correct and incorrect predictions. The confusion matrix for a binary classification problem is typically structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "|                      | **Predicted Positive** | **Predicted Negative** |\n",
    "|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n",
    "| **Actual Positive**  | True Positive (TP)     | False Negative (FN)    |\n",
    "| **Actual Negative**  | False Positive (FP)    | True Negative (TN)     |\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **true positive (TP)** occurs when the model correctly predicts a positive class.\n",
    "- A **true negative (TN)** happens when the model correctly predicts a negative class.\n",
    "- A **false positive (FP)** means the model incorrectly predicts a positive class, which is also known as a Type I error.\n",
    "- A **false negative (FN)** refers to the model incorrectly predicting a negative class, known as a Type II error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Metrics Derived from the Confusion Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy** measures the proportion of total correct predictions made by the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{\\text{TP} + \\text{TN}}{\\text{TP} + \\text{TN} + \\text{FP} + \\text{FN}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "While accuracy is intuitive, it can be misleading in imbalanced datasets where one class significantly outnumbers the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Precision\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision** quantifies the correctness of positive predictions made by the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\text{TP}}{\\text{TP} + \\text{FP}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "High precision indicates a low rate of false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recall (Sensitivity or True Positive Rate)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall** measures the model's ability to identify all actual positive cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Recall} = \\frac{\\text{TP}}{\\text{TP} + \\text{FN}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "High recall indicates a low rate of false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specificity (True Negative Rate)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specificity** assesses the model's ability to identify all actual negative cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Specificity} = \\frac{\\text{TN}}{\\text{TN} + \\text{FP}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "High specificity indicates a low rate of false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### F1 Score\n",
    "\n",
    "The **F1 Score** is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{F1 Score} = 2 \\times \\frac{\\text{Precision} \\times \\text{Recall}}{\\text{Precision} + \\text{Recall}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The F1 Score is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuitive Explanation of Precision and Recall\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are a librarian tasked with retrieving science fiction books from a large library that contains various genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Of all the books you retrieved, how many are actually science fiction?\n",
    "- If you retrieved 50 books and 40 of them are science fiction, your precision is $\\frac{40}{50} = 0.8$ or 80%.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Recall**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Of all the science fiction books in the library, how many did you successfully retrieve?\n",
    "- If there are 100 science fiction books in total and you retrieved 40, your recall is $\\frac{40}{100} = 0.4$ or 40%.\n",
    "\n",
    "High precision means that most of the books you picked are relevant (few false positives), while high recall means you found most of the relevant books (few false negatives).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Calculation\n",

    "#### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "- A higher AUC indicates better model performance.\n",
    "- The ROC curve helps in selecting the optimal threshold that balances sensitivity and specificity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Precision-Recall Curve and AUC\n",

    "In cases of imbalanced datasets, the **Precision-Recall (PR) curve** is more informative than the ROC curve. It plots Precision against Recall for different thresholds.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Regression Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation metrics are crucial in assessing the performance of regression models, which predict a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables. These metrics quantify the discrepancy between the predicted values and the actual observed values, providing insights into the accuracy and reliability of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluating Regression Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In regression analysis, the goal is to build a model that accurately predicts the dependent variable $y$ from one or more independent variables $x $. After fitting a regression model, it is essential to assess its performance using appropriate evaluation metrics. The most commonly used regression metrics include:\n",

    "- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**\n",
    "- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**\n",
    "- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**\n",
    "- **Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$)**\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics provide different perspectives on the model's predictive capabilities and can be used to compare different models or to tune model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualizing Regression Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a dataset where we have generated data points from a sine wave with added noise. We fit a linear regression model to this data to predict $y$ based on $x $. The following plot illustrates the data and the fitted regression line:\n",

    "#### Usage in Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **MAE** is ideal when all errors are considered equally important, and outliers are not a significant concern.\n",
    "- The **MSE/RMSE** are preferable when large errors are highly undesirable, as they penalize these more severely.\n",

    "- A very high **$R^2$** does not necessarily indicate that the model generalizes well to new data, so always check for **overfitting** by validating the model on unseen data.\n",
    "- Perform **residual analysis** by examining residual plots to ensure assumptions of linearity, homoscedasticity (constant variance), and normality of errors are met.\n",
    "- Use **adjusted $R^2$** when comparing models with different numbers of predictors, as it accounts for model complexity.\n"
