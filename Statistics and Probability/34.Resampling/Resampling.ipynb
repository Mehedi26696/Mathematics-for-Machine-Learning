    "##  Simulations in Statistical Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical inference often involves estimating population parameters and constructing confidence intervals based on sample data. Traditional methods rely on assumptions about the sampling distribution of estimators, such as normality and known standard errors. However, these assumptions may not hold, especially with small sample sizes or complex estimators. **Simulations**, like the **Monte Carlo method** and **bootstrap techniques**, offer powerful alternatives to traditional inference by using computational methods to approximate sampling distributions and estimate standard errors.\n",

    "### Confidence Intervals for the Population Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Traditional Confidence Interval\n",
    "\n",
    "For a population mean $\\mu$, the traditional confidence interval is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{x} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2} \\cdot SE(\\bar{x})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\bar{x}$: Sample mean.\n",
    "- $z_{\\alpha/2}$: Critical value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to the desired confidence level $(1 - \\alpha)$.\n",
    "- $SE(\\bar{x})$: Standard error of the sample mean, typically estimated as $\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}$ when the population standard deviation $\\sigma$ is unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations of Traditional Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **normality assumption** assumes that the sample mean $\\bar{x}$ is normally distributed, which may not hold for small sample sizes or non-normal populations.\n",
    "- **Unknown standard error** can be problematic when $SE(\\hat{\\theta})$ is difficult to compute due to complex estimators or unknown population parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulations in Statistical Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulations provide a way to estimate the sampling distribution of an estimator $\\hat{\\theta}$ without relying on strict theoretical assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Monte Carlo Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Monte Carlo method** uses random sampling from a known distribution to approximate numerical results, particularly for estimating parameters and their variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Estimating an Unknown Parameter $\\theta$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **objective** is to estimate a population parameter $\\theta$, such as the average height in the U.S.\n",
    "- The **approach** involves drawing $n$ observations, denoted as $X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n$, from the population.\n",
    "- To estimate, compute the sample mean **$\\hat{\\theta} = \\bar{X}$**.\n",
    "- According to the **law of large numbers**, as $n$ increases, $\\hat{\\theta}$ will converge to the true population parameter $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Estimating the Standard Error $SE(\\hat{\\theta})$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **problem** is that calculating the standard error $SE(\\hat{\\theta})$ analytically can be complex.\n",
    "- A **Monte Carlo solution** involves drawing multiple independent samples to estimate $SE(\\hat{\\theta})$.\n",
    "- **Multiple samples** are drawn, with $B$ independent samples of size $n$ from the population.\n",
    "- For each sample $b$, **compute estimates** $\\hat{\\theta}_b$.\n",
    "- The **standard error** is then estimated using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "SE(\\hat{\\theta}) \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{B - 1} \\sum_{b=1}^{B} (\\hat{\\theta}_b - \\bar{\\hat{\\theta}})^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\bar{\\hat{\\theta}} = \\frac{1}{B} \\sum_{b=1}^{B} \\hat{\\theta}_b$.\n",

    "Bootstrapping allows construction of confidence intervals without relying on normality or known standard errors.\n",

    "- Optionally, **center the residuals** to ensure they have a mean of zero.\n",
    "- Then, **bootstrap samples** are created by resampling residuals $\\hat{e}_i^*$ with replacement, and generating new responses as $Y_i^* = \\hat{a} + \\hat{b} X_i + \\hat{e}_i^*$.\n",

    "#### 3. Wild Bootstrap\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **purpose** of the wild bootstrap is to handle heteroscedasticity, where the variance of errors is not constant.\n",
    "- The **method** involves multiplying residuals by random variables $\\eta_i$ that have a mean of zero and variance of one.\n",
    "- New responses are then generated as $Y_i^* = \\hat{a} + \\hat{b} X_i + \\hat{e}_i \\eta_i$ to account for this variability.\n",

    "### Example: Estimating Variability of Regression Slope Using Residual Resampling\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we demonstrate the Residual Resampling method to estimate the variability of the regression slope $b$.\n",

    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate synthetic data with a known true intercept $a = 3$ and slope $b = 2$, along with random noise.\n",

    "- Perform bootstrapping by resampling residuals, generating new responses, and refitting the model to obtain new estimates $\\hat{a}^*$ and $\\hat{b}^*$.\n",
    "- Repeat the process for $B$ bootstrap samples to estimate the standard error of $\\hat{b}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"r2.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Original Model Fit:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The initial linear regression model provided an estimate for the slope of approximately $\\hat{b} = 1.954$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrap Resampling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We performed $B = 1000$ bootstrap iterations by resampling the residuals from the original model and refitting the model to compute new slope estimates each time.\n",
    "- This process generates a distribution of slope estimates under different bootstrap samples, reflecting the variability in the slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimated Standard Error:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The standard error of the slope was estimated to be 0.0311, indicating the variability of the slope estimates.\n",

    "### Practical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Number of Bootstrap Samples $B$\n",
    "\n",

    "- It is generally **recommended** to use at least $B = 1,000$ when calculating confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **bootstrap method** relies on the sample being representative of the population for accurate results.\n",
    "- **Independence of observations** is crucial, as the bootstrap assumes that each observation is independent of the others.\n",
    "- **Sample size** can affect reliability, with the bootstrap being less dependable when dealing with very small samples.\n"
