    "### Example: Timing in Simulation Game\n",
    "\n",
    "In a simulation game, a developer wants to introduce an event occurring randomly between 2 and 4 seconds after a certain action. This timing follows a continuous uniform distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lower bound $a = 2$ seconds\n",
    "- Upper bound $b = 4$ seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "I. Probability of Event Occurring Within 2.5 Seconds:\n",
    "\n",
    "For a continuous uniform distribution $U(a, b)$, the probability density function is $f(x; a, b) = \\frac{1}{b - a}$ for $a \\leq x \\leq b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the probability of the event happening before 2.5 seconds:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(X < 2.5) = \\frac{2.5 - 2}{4 - 2} = 0.25 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means there is a 25% chance the event will occur within 2.5 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "II. Expected Value and Variance of the Event Timing:\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected value $E[X]$ and variance $\\text{Var}(X)$ for a continuous uniform distribution are calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Expected value (mean time):\n",
    "  \n",
    "$$ E[X] = \\frac{a + b}{2} = \\frac{2 + 4}{2} = 3 \\text{ seconds} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variance:\n",
    "  \n",
    "$$ \\text{Var}(X) = \\frac{(b - a)^2}{12} = \\frac{(4 - 2)^2}{12} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ seconds}^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "These calculations help the developer understand the timing dynamics of the event in the simulation game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniform distributions are often used as a simple model when all possible outcomes are equally likely, such as in random number generators or when sampling from a finite set of values.\n"
