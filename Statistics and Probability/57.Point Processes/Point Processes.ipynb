    "# Point Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "Point processes are mathematical models used to describe and analyze random collections of points distributed in time, space, or both. They are fundamental tools in probability theory and statistics, particularly in fields like spatial statistics, stochastic geometry, queueing theory, and many branches of science and engineering. Point processes model a wide variety of phenomena, such as the timing of events, the locations of objects or occurrences, and patterns formed by random points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Point Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "A point process can be informally thought of as a random countable set of points $\\{x_i\\}$ located within some mathematical space $S$ (e.g., the real line $\\mathbb{R}$, the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$, or higher-dimensional spaces). The randomness pertains to both the number of points and their locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Point Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Events**: Arrival times of customers at a service center, occurrence times of earthquakes, or neuronal spike times.\n",
    "- **Spatial Events**: Locations of trees in a forest, positions of stars in the sky, or the geographic distribution of disease cases.\n",
    "- **Spatiotemporal Events**: Events that have both spatial and temporal components, such as the spread of an epidemic over time and space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, a point process $N$ on a space $S$ is a random measure that counts the number of points in subsets of $S$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "N(B) = \\text{Number of points in } B \\subseteq S\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For Borel sets $B$ in $S$, $N(B)$ is a random variable representing the count of points in $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts in Point Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Intensity Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The intensity function $\\lambda(x)$ (also called the rate or density function) describes the expected number of points per unit volume at location $x$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\lambda(x) = \\lim_{\\delta \\to 0} \\frac{E[N(B_\\delta(x))]}{\\text{Volume}(B_\\delta(x))}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $B_\\delta(x)$ is a small neighborhood around $x$ with volume $\\delta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Homogeneous Point Process**: The intensity $\\lambda(x) = \\lambda$ is constant throughout $S$.\n",
    "- **Inhomogeneous Point Process**: The intensity $\\lambda(x)$ varies with location $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Stationarity and Isotropy\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stationarity**: A point process is stationary if its statistical properties are invariant under translations in space. Formally, for any vector $h$, the distribution of $N(B)$ and $N(B + h)$ is the same.\n",
    "- **Isotropy**: A point process is isotropic if its statistical properties are invariant under rotations. This means the process behaves the same in all directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Complete Spatial Randomness (CSR)\n",
    "\n",
    "A point process exhibits CSR if it is both homogeneous and has no interaction between points (i.e., the presence of a point does not affect the probability of other points occurring). The homogeneous Poisson point process is the classic example of CSR.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Pair Correlation Function and Ripley's K-function\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pair Correlation Function $g(r)$**: Describes the probability of finding a pair of points separated by a distance $r$, relative to that expected for a Poisson process.\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  g(r) = \\frac{\\text{Observed density of point pairs at distance } r}{\\text{Expected density under CSR}}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ripley's K-function**: Measures the expected number of additional points within a distance $r$ of an arbitrary point.\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  K(r) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} E[\\text{Number of other points within distance } r \\text{ of a typical point}]\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Point Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "Point processes can be classified based on their properties and the interactions between points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Poisson Point Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The Poisson point process is the most fundamental and widely used point process. It is characterized by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Independence**: The number of points in disjoint regions are independent random variables.\n",
    "- **Poisson Distribution**: The number of points in any region $B \\subseteq S$ follows a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\Lambda(B) = \\int_B \\lambda(x) \\, dx$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Homogeneous Poisson Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intensity**: $\\lambda(x) = \\lambda$ (constant).\n",
    "- **Mean number of points in region $B$**: $E[N(B)] = \\lambda \\cdot \\text{Volume}(B)$.\n",
    "- **Independence**: Points occur independently of one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inhomogeneous Poisson Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intensity**: $\\lambda(x)$ varies with location $x$.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Models processes where the rate of occurrence changes over space or time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Cox Process (Doubly Stochastic Poisson Process)\n",
    "\n",
    "A Cox process generalizes the Poisson process by allowing the intensity function $\\lambda(x)$ itself to be a random function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random Intensity**: $\\lambda(x)$ is a realization of a stochastic process.\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: Introduces extra variability (overdispersion) compared to a Poisson process.\n",
    "- **Applications**: Modeling clustering due to environmental heterogeneity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Cluster Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster processes model situations where points tend to form clusters rather than being independently scattered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Neyman-Scott Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parent Process**: Generate parent points according to a Poisson process.\n",
    "- **Offspring Process**: Around each parent point, generate a random number of offspring points with a specified spatial distribution (e.g., Gaussian).\n",
    "- **Result**: Clusters of points around parent locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thomas Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A special case of the Neyman-Scott process where offspring points are normally distributed around parent points.\n",
    "- **Intensity Function**: The overall intensity $\\lambda(x)$ is determined by the parameters of the parent and offspring processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Hard-Core Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "Hard-core processes model repulsion between points, preventing them from being too close to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Minimum Distance**: There exists a hard-core distance $r_h$ such that no two points are closer than $r_h$.\n",
    "- **Applications**: Modeling phenomena where objects cannot overlap or be too close, such as the locations of trees competing for resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Determinantal and Gibbs Point Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Determinantal Point Processes**: Model repulsive interactions using determinants; have applications in physics and machine learning.\n",
    "- **Gibbs Point Processes**: Use potential functions to model interactions between points, representing both attraction and repulsion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts Elaborated\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intensity Measure and Conditional Intensity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intensity Measure $\\Lambda(B)$**: For region $B$, $\\Lambda(B) = E[N(B)]$.\n",
    "- **Conditional Intensity $\\lambda^*(x \\mid \\mathcal{F}_x)$**: The expected rate at which events occur at location $x$, given past events up to $x$, where $\\mathcal{F}_x$ is the history up to $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Campbell's Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Provides a fundamental relationship for expectations over point processes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E\\left[ \\sum_{x_i \\in N} f(x_i) \\right] = \\int_S f(x) \\lambda(x) \\, dx\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $f(x)$ is a measurable function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications of Point Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "Point processes are used to model and analyze random events in various fields.\n",

    "## Example: Modeling Tree Locations in a Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "We are studying the spatial locations of trees in a forest, with each tree represented as a point in two-dimensional space. Our aim is to model the spatial distribution and compare it with different types of spatial processes to understand potential ecological dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plot 1: **Observed Spatial Distribution of Trees (Poisson Process)**\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pp1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first plot shows the spatial distribution of trees as randomly placed points (green \"X\"s) across a grid. The distribution appears to reflect a **Poisson point process**, where points (trees) are scattered randomly without any apparent clustering or regular spacing.\n",
    "- The random scattering of trees suggests that there may not be any underlying ecological interactions such as competition or facilitation. The trees seem to be placed without regard to one another, which is characteristic of a **Poisson process**. No visible clustering or regularity is evident in this plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plot 2: **Simulated Cluster Point Process (For Comparison)**\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pp2.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- The second plot shows a **cluster point process** (blue \"X\"s), where trees tend to group together in distinct clusters, instead of being randomly distributed as in the first plot.\n",
    "- The comparison between this clustered distribution and the random distribution in the first plot highlights different spatial processes. A **clustered process** like this one could be indicative of ecological factors that cause trees to grow in proximity to one another, such as shared resources, reproduction patterns, or environmental heterogeneity. This process differs significantly from the Poisson process, which lacks clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis and Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessing Complete Spatial Randomness\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Visual Inspection**: If the trees in the observed plot appear to be randomly scattered without discernible patterns of clustering or regular spacing, this might suggest that a Poisson point process is an appropriate model.\n",
    "- **Statistical Tests**: To objectively assess randomness, we can use functions like Ripley's K-function or the pair correlation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ripley's K-function\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Measures the expected number of points within a distance $r$ of a typical point, compared to that expected under complete spatial randomness.\n",
    "- **Interpretation**:\n",
    "  - **K-function Above CSR Line**: Indicates clustering; more points are found within distance $r$ than expected under CSR.\n",
    "  - **K-function Below CSR Line**: Indicates regularity or inhibition; fewer points are found within distance $r$ than expected under CSR.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pair Correlation Function ($g(r)$)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Describes the probability of finding a pair of points at a certain distance apart, relative to what would be expected under CSR.\n",
    "- **Interpretation**:\n",
    "  - **$g(r) > 1$**: Clustering at distance $r$.\n",
    "  - **$g(r) = 1$**: Randomness at distance $r$.\n",
    "  - **$g(r) < 1$**: Regularity or repulsion at distance $r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Possible Models Based on Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Poisson Point Process\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Appropriate When**: The spatial pattern shows complete spatial randomness.\n",
    "- **Characteristics**: Points occur independently and uniformly across the space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cluster Process (e.g., Thomas Process)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Appropriate When**: The spatial pattern exhibits clustering.\n",
    "- **Mechanism**: Points tend to cluster around parent points due to processes like seed dispersal in trees.\n",
    "- **Modeling Approach**: Use a cluster process where parent points are distributed according to a Poisson process, and offspring points (trees) are scattered around the parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hard-Core Process\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Appropriate When**: The spatial pattern shows regularity or repulsion, with a minimum distance between trees.\n",
    "- **Mechanism**: Competition for resources leads to inhibitory interactions among trees.\n",
    "- **Modeling Approach**: Incorporate a hard-core distance into the model to prevent points from being too close.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps in Modeling\n",
