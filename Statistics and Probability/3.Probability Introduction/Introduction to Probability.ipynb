    "# Introduction to Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability theory offers a structured approach to assessing the probability of events, allowing for logical and systematic reasoning about their likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introductory Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "- An **experiment** refers to any procedure that can be repeated indefinitely and has a clearly defined set of possible outcomes, known as the sample space. Examples include rolling dice, flipping coins, or drawing cards from a deck.\n",
    "- The **sample space (S)** represents the complete set of possible outcomes of an experiment. It can be finite or infinite, and either discrete or continuous. For example, for a 6-sided die, the sample space is $S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. For a coin flip, the sample space is $S = \\{\\text{heads}, \\text{tails}\\}$. If two coins are flipped simultaneously, the sample space expands to $S = \\{(\\text{H}, \\text{H}), (\\text{H}, \\text{T}), (\\text{T}, \\text{H}), (\\text{T}, \\text{T})\\}$.\n",
    "- An **event (E)** is any collection of outcomes drawn from the sample space $S$, forming a subset of $S$. An event can consist of a single outcome or multiple outcomes. For example, rolling an even number on a die corresponds to the event $E = \\{2, 4, 6\\}$, getting tails when flipping a coin is $E = \\{\\text{tails}\\}$, and drawing a heart from a standard deck of cards is $E = \\{2\\heartsuit, 3\\heartsuit, \\dots, A\\heartsuit\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Dice Rolling\n",
    "\n",
    "When you roll a 6-sided (fair) die, the sample space is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And the possible events include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Odd Numbers = ${1, 3, 5}$\n",
    "* Even Numbers = ${2, 4, 6}$\n",
    "* Rolling at Least a 5 = ${5, 6}$\n",
    "* Prime Numbers = ${2, 3, 5}$\n",
    "* Rolling a Number Less Than 4 = ${1, 2, 3}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each event is a subset of the sample space and represents a particular outcome or set of outcomes that we are interested in observing. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely that event is to occur, calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes (the size of event set) by the total number of possible outcomes (the size of sample space).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- In **traffic observation**, counting the number of accidents at an intersection over a month defines the sample space as $S = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots, n\\}$, where $n$ represents a reasonable upper limit based on historical data.\n",
    "- The **life span of a light bulb** measured in hours has a sample space of any positive number, formally $S = \\{t \\mid t > 0\\}$. In practice, this could be limited to a range such as $S = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10000\\}$ hours.\n",
    "- For an individual's **birth month**, the sample space is $S = \\{\\text{January}, \\text{February}, \\dots, \\text{December}\\}$.\n",
    "- In the case of **radioactive decay**, where decay occurs in intervals of 1 second, the sample space consists of sequences of decay (D) and non-decay (N), such as $S = \\{\\text{D}, \\text{ND}, \\text{NND}, \\text{NNND}, \\dots\\}$.\n",
    "- When **rolling two dice**, the sample space for the sum of the points on the two dice is $S = \\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\\}$.\n",
    "- In the **seating at a square table** scenario, if two people can sit at any of the four corners, the sample space for their seating positions can be represented as pairs of positions.\n",

    "## Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability is a measure that quantifies the likelihood of a specific event occurring, given a set of possible outcomes. It is a value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates that the event is impossible, and 1 indicates that the event is certain. Mathematically, the probability of an event A, denoted as P(A), can be expressed as:\n",

    "  * $0 \\leq P(s) \\leq 1$ for each outcome $s$.\n",
    "  * The sum of the probabilities of all outcomes equals 1, or $\\sum_{s \\in S} P(s) = 1$, where $S$ is the sample space.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Probability of an Event (P(E))**: The probability of an event E is determined by adding up the probabilities of the outcomes that compose E. Mathematically, this is represented by the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(E) = \\sum_{s \\in E} P(s)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **random variable** X is a function that assigns a numerical value to each outcome in a sample space. For instance, X could represent the total number of points scored in a basketball game.\n",
    "* The **expected value** of a random variable X gives a measure of the central tendency of the distribution of the random variable. It is computed as the weighted average of all possible values that the random variable can take on, with the weights being the probabilities of the values. The formula for the expected value is:\n",
    "\n",
