    "## Student's t-Distribution (Continuous)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Student's t-distribution, or simply t-distribution, is a continuous probability distribution that arises when estimating the mean of a normally distributed population in situations where the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown. The t-distribution is denoted as $X \\sim t(\\nu)$, where $\\nu$ is the number of degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability Density Function (PDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDF of a t-distribution is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\nu + 1}{2}\\right)}{\\sqrt{\\nu \\pi} \\, \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{\\nu}{2}\\right)} \\left(1 + \\frac{x^2}{\\nu}\\right)^{-\\frac{\\nu + 1}{2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Gamma(\\cdot)$ is the gamma function.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"s1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF of a t-distribution can be expressed in terms of the regularized incomplete beta function, $I_x(a, b)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F(x) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} I_{\\frac{x^2}{x^2 + \\nu}}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\nu}{2}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"s2.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Value and Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected value (mean) of a t-distribution is equal to 0 for $\\nu > 1$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[X] = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance of a t-distribution is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Var}(X) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "  \\frac{\\nu}{\\nu - 2}, & \\text{if}\\ \\nu > 2 \\\\\n",
    "  \\infty, & \\text{if}\\ 1 < \\nu \\le 2 \\\\\n",
    "  \\text{undefined}, & \\text{if}\\ \\nu \\le 1\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Moment Generating Functions and Moments\n",
    "\n",
    "The moment generating function (MGF) of a t-distribution does not exist due to the heavy tails of the distribution. However, we can compute the moments directly from the PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **First Moment (Mean):**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[X] = 0, \\text{ for } \\nu > 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Second Moment (Variance + Mean^2):**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[X^2] = \\nu, \\text{ for } \\nu > 2$$\n",

    "### Example: Analyzing the Effect of Diet on Blood Pressure\n",
    "\n",
    "A researcher investigates whether two diets lead to different average systolic blood pressure. The following data is collected from a random sample:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Diet A: Sample size (n1) = 20, Mean (mean1) = 120, Standard Deviation (s1) = 8\n",
    "- Diet B: Sample size (n2) = 25, Mean (mean2) = 130, Standard Deviation (s2) = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare the means, a two-sample t-test is employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "I. Calculation of the T-statistic:\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-statistic is calculated using the formula for the two-sample t-test:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ t = \\frac{(\\text{mean1} - \\text{mean2})}{\\sqrt{(\\text{s1}^2/\\text{n1}) + (\\text{s2}^2/\\text{n2})}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the given data:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ t = \\frac{(120 - 130)}{\\sqrt{(8^2/20) + (10^2/25)}} \\approx -3.78 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This value indicates the number of standard deviations the sample mean difference is from 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "II. Estimation of Degrees of Freedom:\n",
    "\n",
    "The degrees of freedom can be estimated using the Welch-Satterthwaite equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ df \\approx \\frac{((\\text{s1}^2/\\text{n1}) + (\\text{s2}^2/\\text{n2}))^2}{(\\text{s1}^4/(\\text{n1}^2(\\text{n1}-1)) + \\text{s2}^4/(\\text{n2}^2(\\text{n2}-1)))} \\approx 40.4 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "These degrees of freedom are used in determining the critical value of t from the t-distribution table for the hypothesis test.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Student's t-distributions are widely used in hypothesis testing (such as the one-sample t-test, two-sample t-test, and paired t-test), confidence interval estimation for the population mean, and in regression analysis. They are particularly useful when the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown.\n"
