    "# Spatial Autocorrelation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spatial autocorrelation** refers to the correlation of a variable with itself through space. It measures the degree to which similar or dissimilar values of a variable are clustered or dispersed in a geographical area. This concept is rooted in **Tobler's First Law of Geography**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding spatial autocorrelation is fundamental in spatial analysis, geography, environmental science, and many other fields dealing with spatial data.\n",

    "## Types of Spatial Autocorrelation\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial autocorrelation can be classified into three types:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Positive Spatial Autocorrelation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Occurs when similar values cluster together in space.\n",
    "- **Implication**: High values are surrounded by high values, and low values are surrounded by low values.\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "- Elevation levels in a mountainous region.\n",
    "- Temperature distributions where warmer areas are adjacent to other warm areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Negative Spatial Autocorrelation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Occurs when dissimilar values are adjacent.\n",
    "- **Implication**: High values are near low values, creating a checkerboard pattern.\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "- Agricultural land alternating with urban areas.\n",
    "- Predatory and prey species distributions in an ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Zero Spatial Autocorrelation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: No apparent spatial pattern; values are randomly distributed in space.\n",
    "- **Implication**: Location does not influence attribute similarity.\n",

    "### Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are studying the distribution of a certain species of tree across a national park. Each tree is a point in space, and the attribute of interest is the **tree's height**.\n",

    "- **Positive Spatial Autocorrelation**: Tall trees tend to be near other tall trees, and short trees tend to be near other short trees.\n",
    "- **Possible Reasons**:\n",
    "- **Soil Quality**: Areas with richer soil nutrients support taller trees.\n",

    "- Commonly, $w_{ij} = 1$ if locations $i$ and $j$ are neighbors; otherwise, $w_{ij} = 0$.\n",
