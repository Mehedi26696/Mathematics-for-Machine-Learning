    "## Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF)\n",
    "\n",
    "In time series analysis, understanding the relationships between observations at different time lags is crucial for model identification and forecasting. Two essential tools for analyzing these relationships are the **Autocorrelation Function (ACF)** and the **Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **ACF** measures the correlation between observations at different time lags.\n",
    "- The **PACF** isolates the direct effect of a specific lag by removing the influence of intermediate lags.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Autocorrelation Function (ACF)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Autocorrelation Function (ACF)** measures the correlation between a time series and its lagged values. It helps detect patterns such as trends and seasonality. The autocorrelation at lag $k$, denoted $\\rho_k$, is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\rho_k = \\frac{\\gamma_k}{\\gamma_0}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\gamma_k$ is the autocovariance at lag $k$.\n",
    "- $\\gamma_0$ is the variance of the time series (autocovariance at lag 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Autocovariance Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The **autocovariance** at lag $k$ is the covariance between observations separated by $k$ time periods. It is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\gamma_k = \\text{Cov}(X_t, X_{t+k}) = \\mathbb{E}[(X_t - \\mu)(X_{t+k} - \\mu)]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mu$ is the mean of the time series.\n",
    "- $\\mathbb{E}$ denotes the expectation operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Autocorrelation Coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "The **autocorrelation coefficient** at lag $k$ normalizes the autocovariance $\\gamma_k$ by dividing it by the variance $\\gamma_0$. It is a dimensionless quantity that ranges between -1 and 1, making it easier to interpret:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\rho_k = \\frac{\\gamma_k}{\\gamma_0} = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[(X_t - \\mu)(X_{t+k} - \\mu)]}{\\mathbb{E}[(X_t - \\mu)^2]}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sample Autocorrelation Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the ACF is estimated from the data using sample autocorrelations. The **sample autocorrelation coefficient** $r_k$ at lag $k$ is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r_k = \\frac{\\sum_{t=1}^{N-k} (x_t - \\bar{x})(x_{t+k} - \\bar{x})}{\\sum_{t=1}^{N} (x_t - \\bar{x})^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\bar{x}$ is the sample mean of the series.\n",
    "- $N$ is the number of observations.\n",
    "- $x_t$ is the observed value at time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Plotting the ACF\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Autocorrelation Function (ACF) plot**, or **Correlogram**, is a useful tool for understanding the structure of time series data. In Python, you can generate and interpret the ACF plot using libraries like `statsmodels` and `matplotlib`. The ACF plot helps identify significant correlations at different lags and reveals patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "e ACF plot can provide answers to the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Is the observed time series white noise / random?\n",
    "    Is an observation related to an adjacent observation, an observation twice-removed, and so on?\n",
    "    Can the observed time series be modeled with an MA model? If yes, what is the order?\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points for Interpreting the ACF Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the ACF values decrease slowly over many lags, this suggests the presence of a **trend** in the data.\n",
    "2. Repeated peaks or cyclic behavior in the ACF plot indicate **seasonal patterns** in the data, with regular intervals of high correlation.\n",
    "3. A rapid drop-off or sharp cutoff after a few lags suggests the data may follow a **Moving Average (MA)** process, where the current value is explained by a few prior error terms (shocks).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a Python example where we generate and plot the ACF for three different types of time series: one with a trend, one with seasonal patterns, and one following a moving average process.\n",

    "### Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF)** measures the correlation between the time series and its lagged values, after removing the linear effects of the intermediate lags. It helps isolate the direct impact of each lag.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PACF at lag $k$, denoted by $\\phi_{kk}$, represents the correlation between $X_t$ and $X_{t+k}$, after accounting for the effect of $X_{t+1}, X_{t+2}, \\dots, X_{t+k-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Yule-Walker Equations\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Recursive Calculation of PACF\n",
    "\n",
    "The PACF at lag $k$ can be recursively calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "I. $\\phi_{11} = \\rho_1$\n",

    "II. For $k \\geq 2$:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Plotting the PACF\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plot** is a valuable tool for understanding the relationship between a time series and its lagged values after accounting for the influence of intervening lags. Unlike the ACF, which shows the correlation between the series and its lagged values, the PACF removes the effect of any intermediate lags.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PACF is particularly useful for identifying the order of an **Autoregressive (AR) process**. If you suspect your time series follows an AR model, the PACF plot can help you determine the number of lag terms to include in your model.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    Can the observed time series be modeled with an AR model? If yes, what is the order?\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points for Interpreting the PACF Plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Significant spikes at early lags indicate that those specific lags are important for modeling the time series. For an **AR(p)** process, you will see significant spikes up to lag \\( p \\), and the PACF will then cut off.\n",
    "2. A sharp drop after lag \\( p \\) suggests that the time series follows an **AR(p)** process, meaning that only \\( p \\) past observations are needed to model the series.\n",
    "3. If the PACF plot exhibits a gradual decay, this indicates the presence of a **Moving Average (MA) process**, since partial correlations decrease slowly over many lags.\n",
    "\n",

    "- For the ARMA(1,1) process, the PACF plot may show significant spikes at early lags, reflecting the autoregressive part, followed by a slower decay, reflecting the moving average component.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing ACF and PACF\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **ACF** measures the correlation between the time series and its lagged values, capturing both direct and indirect effects (i.e., effects from intermediate lags).\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\rho_k = \\phi^k\n",
