    "## Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "A hypothesis is a statement that might be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a key tool in the field of statistics and forms the backbone of scientific research. It helps us make decisions about population parameters using sample data. Hypothesis testing is used across a wide variety of fields - from testing the effectiveness of a new drug in medical trials, to understanding customer behavior in business analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs and Outputs of Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **null hypothesis ($H_0$)** represents the default assumption or the status quo, indicating no effect or no difference. Hypothesis testing aims to challenge this statement.\n",
    "2. The **alternative hypothesis ($H_1$ or $H_a$)** is the claim that the test seeks to support, indicating the presence of an effect or difference.\n",
    "3. The **significance level ($\\alpha$)** is a pre-determined threshold, usually set at 0.05, which defines the risk of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true (Type I error).\n",
    "4. **Sample data** refers to the collected data from observations, experiments, or surveys, providing the basis for calculating the test statistic and the p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **p-value** is the probability of observing data as extreme as, or more extreme than, the sample data, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value (typically ≤ $\\alpha$) provides strong evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of Hypothesis Testing Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a structured process involving several steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The process begins by **formulating hypotheses**, where the null and alternative hypotheses are defined based on the research question.\n",
    "2. Next, a **significance level ($\\alpha$)** is chosen, often set at 0.05, but it can be adjusted depending on the study's requirements or field norms.\n",
    "3. **Data collection** is conducted systematically to ensure the data is representative and free from bias.\n",
    "4. After collecting the data, the **test statistic** is calculated using an appropriate formula to convert the sample data into a value suitable for hypothesis testing.\n",
    "5. The **p-value** is then determined, representing the probability of obtaining the observed or more extreme test statistic under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "6. In **decision making**, $H_0$ is rejected if the p-value is less than $\\alpha$; otherwise, you fail to reject $H_0$.\n",
    "7. Finally, **interpreting results** involves understanding the decision in the context of the research question. Failing to reject $H_0$ does not prove it is true, only that there isn’t strong evidence against it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Marble Bags\n",
    "Imagine two bags: Bag A with a mix of 5 white and 5 black marbles, and Bag B with only black marbles.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  Bag A            Bag B\n",
    "  _____            _____\n",
    " / • •  \\         / O O  \\\n",
    "|  • •  |        |  O O  |    O = White Marble\n",
    "|  O O  |        |  O O  |    • = Black Marble\n",
    "|  O O  |        |  O O  |    \n",
    "|  • O  |        |  O O  |\n",
    " \\_____/          \\_____/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Suspecting you have Bag B, you decide to test this hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **null hypothesis ($H_0$)** states that the bag in question is Bag A.\n",
    "- The **alternative hypothesis ($H_a$)** asserts that the bag in question is Bag B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drawing `n` marbles and finding them all black leads to calculating p-values to test these hypotheses. For Bag A, the chance of drawing a black marble is 0.5. Hence, drawing `n` black marbles consecutively from Bag A has a probability of $(0.5)^n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For n=2, p-value = $(0.5)^2 = 0.25$\n",
    "- For n=3, p-value = $(0.5)^3 = 0.125$\n",
    "- For n=5, p-value = $(0.5)^5 = 0.03125$\n",
    "\n",
    "A smaller p-value indicates stronger evidence against $H_0$. As `n` increases, the likelihood that you have Bag B (only black marbles) increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Null and Alternative Hypotheses for a Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "When testing the population mean, hypothesis testing considers three possibilities, each with distinct null and alternative hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "**I. Left-Tailed Test**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **null hypothesis ($H_0$)** states that the population mean $\\mu$ is equal to a specific value $\\mu_0$ ($\\mu = \\mu_0$).\n",
    "- The **alternative hypothesis ($H_a$)** claims that $\\mu$ is less than $\\mu_0$ ($\\mu < \\mu_0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "**II. Right-Tailed Test**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **null hypothesis ($H_0$)** suggests that $\\mu$ is equal to $\\mu_0$ ($\\mu = \\mu_0$).\n",
    "- The **alternative hypothesis ($H_a$)** asserts that $\\mu$ is greater than $\\mu_0$ ($$\\mu > \\mu_0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "**III. Two-Tailed Test**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **null hypothesis ($H_0$)** states that $\\mu$ is equal to $\\mu_0$ ($\\mu = \\mu_0$).\n",
    "- The **alternative hypothesis ($H_a$)** proposes that $\\mu$ is not equal to $\\mu_0$ ($\\mu \\neq \\mu_0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis always assumes that the population mean $\\mu$ equals a predetermined value $\\mu_0$. The alternative hypothesis presents a contrary statement: the population mean $\\mu$ is less than, greater than, or not equal to $\\mu_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:** Left-tailed and right-tailed tests are typically used when the effect is expected to occur in only one direction or when only one-directional effects are relevant. In most research scenarios, a two-tailed test is preferred unless there's strong justification for a one-tailed test.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**I. Testing the Effectiveness of a New Diet (Two-Tailed Test)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **null hypothesis ($H_0$)** is that the average daily energy expenditure $\\mu$ equals the standard diet average $\\mu_0$.\n",
    "- The **alternative hypothesis ($H_a$)** is that the average daily energy expenditure $\\mu$ differs from the standard diet average $\\mu_0$ ($\\mu \\neq \\mu_0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "**II. Evaluating Customer Service Efficiency (Left-Tailed Test)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **null hypothesis ($H_0$)** states that the average resolution time $\\mu$ equals the industry standard of 10 minutes.\n",
    "- The **alternative hypothesis ($H_a$)** is that the average resolution time $\\mu$ is less than 10 minutes ($\\mu < 10$).\n",
    "\n",
    "**III. Assessing the Impact of a New Teaching Method (Right-Tailed Test)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **null hypothesis ($H_0$)** suggests that the average test score $\\mu$ equals the district average of 75%.\n",
    "- The **alternative hypothesis ($H_a$)** asserts that the average test score $\\mu$ exceeds the district average of 75% ($\\mu > 75$).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The P-value\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is collected and the sample statistic computed, the researcher computes the P-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The P-value is the probability of obtaining a measurement at least as extreme as the one we measured, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"h1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a **left-tailed test**, the shaded area represents the **p-value**, which is the area under the curve to the left of the sample statistic.\n",
    "- In a **right-tailed test**, the shaded area represents the **p-value**, which is the area under the curve to the right of the sample statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "By at least as extreme, we mean a value at least as far to the left or right of the measured value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing the Right Statistical Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting a suitable statistical test is critical in hypothesis testing, and several factors determine the appropriate choice:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Factors to Consider\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **type of data** (categorical, ordinal, interval, or ratio) significantly influences the choice of statistical test, as different types of data require different methods.\n",
    "2. The **number of variables** under analysis determines the test type, with specific tests designed for univariate (one variable), bivariate (two variables), and multivariate (more than two variables) analyses.\n",
    "3. The **distribution of the data** is crucial, as parametric tests assume a normal distribution. If the data does not meet this assumption, a non-parametric test is more appropriate.\n",
    "4. The **study design**, such as comparing groups or measuring changes over time within a group, also plays a role in selecting the correct statistical test.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Statistical Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **t-test** is ideal for comparing the means of two groups with interval or ratio data that is normally distributed. For non-normally distributed data or ordinal data, consider a non-parametric alternative like the **Mann-Whitney U test**.\n",
    "- To compare means across more than two groups, an **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)** is appropriate. \n",
    "- For categorical data, a **chi-square test** is often used to examine differences in proportions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following table summarizes some common statistical tests and their applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Test                         | Data Type           | Number of Groups | Assumptions                                      |\n",
    "|------------------------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n",

    "\n",
    "### Key Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Left-tailed** and **right-tailed tests** are specific to the direction of the hypothesis. A left-tailed test is used when the research hypothesis suggests a decrease or lower value, while a right-tailed test is for an increase or higher value.\n",
    "- **Two-tailed tests** are applied when the research question does not specify a direction of effect. These tests are more conservative and broadly applicable.\n",
    "- **Parametric tests** assume underlying statistical distributions and typically require interval or ratio data. In contrast, **non-parametric tests** do not assume a specific distribution and are often used with ordinal data or when the assumptions of parametric tests are not met.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Example: Hypothesis Test for the Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "An agronomist suggests that a new fertilizer increases the average yield of a particular crop to more than 2 tons per hectare. To test this claim, a study is conducted where the new fertilizer is applied to randomly selected plots. The yield of 25 plots is measured, resulting in a mean yield of 2.1 tons per hectare and a standard deviation of 0.3 tons per hectare. Is the new fertilizer effective at increasing the average yield at a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis Setup**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): $\\mu = 2$ tons per hectare (The fertilizer does not increase yield)\n",
    "- Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$): $\\mu > 2$ tons per hectare (The fertilizer increases yield)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Statistic**:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the test statistic, we use the one-sample z-test since the sample size is greater than 30:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}$$\n",

    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\bar{x}$ is the sample mean,\n",
    "- $\\mu_0$ is the hypothesized population mean,\n",
    "- $\\sigma$ is the population standard deviation (approximated here by the sample standard deviation),\n",
    "- $n$ is the sample size.\n",

    "$$z \\approx 1.667$$\n",

    "We look up the critical z-value for a right-tailed test at $\\alpha = 0.05$, which is approximately 1.645. Since our calculated z-value of 1.667 is greater than 1.645, we reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
