    "## Geometric Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometric probability is a fascinating branch of probability theory where outcomes are associated with geometric figures and their measures—such as lengths, areas, and volumes—rather than discrete numerical outcomes. It often deals with continuous random variables and employs integral calculus to calculate probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In geometric probability, the probability of an event is typically determined by the ratio of the measure (length, area, volume) of the favorable outcomes to the measure of the entire sample space. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with problems involving random points in geometric figures.\n",
