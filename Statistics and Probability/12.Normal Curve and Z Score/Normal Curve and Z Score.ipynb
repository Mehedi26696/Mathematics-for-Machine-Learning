    "## The Normal Curve and Z-Scores\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Normal Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "A **normal distribution** (often referred to as the *normal curve* or *Gaussian distribution*) is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, where most of the observations cluster around the central peak and taper off symmetrically towards both ends. Many real-world datasets such as human heights, IQ scores, and measurement errors exhibit this kind of distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability density function (PDF) of the normal distribution is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x | \\mu, \\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2 \\pi}} e^{ -\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2} }\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mu$ is the mean,\n",
    "- $\\sigma^2$ is the variance (with $\\sigma$ being the standard deviation),\n",
    "- $e$ is Euler's number,\n",
    "- $\\pi$ is the constant Pi.\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula describes the shape of the curve mathematically. The mean $\\mu$ determines the center of the distribution, and the standard deviation $\\sigma$ determines the width of the bell curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"n1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- The distribution of adult **heights** usually follows a normal pattern, where most individuals cluster around the average height, with fewer people being much shorter or taller.\n",
    "- When it comes to **IQ scores**, they are designed to follow a normal distribution, with the average score set at 100 and a standard deviation of 15, meaning most people score close to this mean.\n",
    "- Not all data sets are normally distributed; for example, **incomes** tend to be skewed because a small proportion of people earn extremely high salaries, which significantly raises the overall average.\n",
    "- Similarly, **house prices** are often skewed, as a small number of very expensive properties can disproportionately affect the overall data, making the mean house price higher than what most people actually pay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7 Rule)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Empirical Rule** provides a rough estimate for the spread of data in a normal distribution. It applies to any dataset that approximately follows the normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **68% of the data** falls within **1 standard deviation** of the mean, i.e., between $\\mu - \\sigma$ and $\\mu + \\sigma$.\n",
    "- **95% of the data** falls within **2 standard deviations** of the mean, i.e., between $\\mu - 2\\sigma$ and $\\mu + 2\\sigma$.\n",
    "- **99.7% of the data** falls within **3 standard deviations** of the mean, i.e., between $\\mu - 3\\sigma$ and $\\mu + 3\\sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset where the heights of fathers are normally distributed with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean height $\\mu = 68.3$ inches,\n",
    "- Standard deviation $\\sigma = 1.8$ inches.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Empirical Rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "- About **68%** of the heights will lie between $68.3 - 1.8 = 66.5$ inches and $68.3 + 1.8 = 70.1$ inches.\n",
    "- About **95%** of the heights will lie between $68.3 - 2(1.8) = 64.7$ inches and $68.3 + 2(1.8) = 71.9$ inches.\n",
    "- About **99.7%** of the heights will lie between $68.3 - 3(1.8) = 62.9$ inches and $68.3 + 3(1.8) = 73.7$ inches.\n",
    "\n",
    "These intervals can be visualized as follows:\n",

    "### Standardizing Data and Z-Scores\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare values from different normal distributions or to work with a standardized form of a dataset, we can convert raw data values to **z-scores**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition of Z-Score\n",
    "The **z-score** is a way of describing a value in terms of how many standard deviations it is away from the mean. The formula for the z-score is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x$ is the raw score (the value you are standardizing),\n",
    "- $\\mu$ is the mean of the dataset,\n",
    "- $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A z-score tells us:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $z = 0$: The value is exactly at the mean.\n",
    "- $z > 0$: The value is above the mean.\n",
    "- $z < 0$: The value is below the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "Suppose a father is 71.9 inches tall. We want to find his z-score given that the mean height is 68.3 inches and the standard deviation is 1.8 inches.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "z = \\frac{71.9 - 68.3}{1.8} = \\frac{3.6}{1.8} = 2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that a height of 71.9 inches is 2 standard deviations above the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, if a father is 67.4 inches tall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "z = \\frac{67.4 - 68.3}{1.8} = \\frac{-0.9}{1.8} = -0.5\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that a height of 67.4 inches is 0.5 standard deviations below the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard Normal Distribution\n",
    "After converting all values in a normal distribution to z-scores, we obtain the **standard normal distribution**, which has:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A mean $\\mu = 0$,\n",
    "- A standard deviation $\\sigma = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard normal distribution is often used in statistics because it allows for easy computation of probabilities and comparison across different datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding Areas Under the Normal Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the proportion of data within a certain range, we can use **z-scores** to convert the raw data points and then look up the corresponding probabilities using a **z-table** or statistical software. The area under the normal curve between two z-scores represents the proportion of data that lies between those values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "To find the proportion of fathers with heights between 67.4 inches and 71.9 inches, we first compute the z-scores for these heights:\n",
    "\n",
    "For 67.4 inches:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "z_{67.4} = \\frac{67.4 - 68.3}{1.8} = -0.5\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For 71.9 inches:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "z_{71.9} = \\frac{71.9 - 68.3}{1.8} = 2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, using a z-table (or software), we find the area to the left of these z-scores:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The area to the left of $z = -0.5$ is approximately **0.3085** (30.85%).\n",
    "- The area to the left of $z = 2$ is approximately **0.9772** (97.72%).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the proportion of fathers with heights between 67.4 and 71.9 inches is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(67.4 \\leq \\text{height} \\leq 71.9) = 0.9772 - 0.3085 = 0.6687 \\approx 66.87\\%\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"n3.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing Percentiles\n",
    "\n",
    "The **percentile** of a value in a normal distribution tells us the percentage of the data that is less than or equal to that value. To compute percentiles, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find the z-score corresponding to the desired percentile using a z-table or statistical software.\n",
    "2. Convert the z-score back into the raw data value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "Suppose we want to compute the **30th percentile** of fathers' heights. Using a z-table, we find that the z-score corresponding to the 30th percentile is approximately $z = -0.52$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the corresponding height, we use the z-score formula in reverse:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{height} = \\mu + z\\sigma = 68.3 + (-0.52)(1.8) = 68.3 - 0.936 = 67.364 \\text{ inches}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the 30th percentile corresponds to a height of approximately **67.36 inches**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process can be applied to any percentile by finding the appropriate z-score and converting it back to the original scale using the mean and standard deviation of the dataset.\n"
