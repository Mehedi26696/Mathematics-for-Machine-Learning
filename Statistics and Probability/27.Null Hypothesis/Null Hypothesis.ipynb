    "## Null Hypotheses and Alternative Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistical hypothesis testing, we construct two opposing hypotheses to make inferences about a population parameter based on sample data:\n",
    "Hereâ€™s the revision with clear points and no nesting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **null hypothesis ($H_0$)** represents the assumption that there is no effect, no difference, or no change in the population. It serves as the default assumption in hypothesis testing.\n",
    "2. The **alternative hypothesis ($H_1$ or $H_a$)** challenges the null hypothesis by suggesting that there is an effect, a difference, or a change in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to use statistical evidence from sample data to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"n1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot illustrates the distribution of a test statistic under the assumption that the null hypothesis $H_0$ is true. Here's a detailed explanation of the components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **green curve (null distribution)** represents the probability density function (pdf) of the test statistic under the null hypothesis ($H_0$). This is often a standard normal distribution centered at zero.\n",
    "- The **vertical dashed red line** marks the observed value of the test statistic from the sample data, such as $z = 2.0$.\n",
    "- The **orange shaded area (tail area)** shows the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the observed value under $H_0$. In a one-tailed test, this corresponds to the p-value, while in a two-tailed test, an equivalent area on the opposite side is also considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Language of Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the evidence (based on the p-value) is strong enough, we **reject $H_0$**, suggesting that there is statistically significant evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "- When the evidence is insufficient, we **fail to reject $H_0$**. This does not mean we accept $H_0$ as true, but rather that we do not have enough evidence to conclude it is false.\n",
    "- It's important to **avoid \"accepting\" $H_0$**, as statistical tests are meant to assess whether there is sufficient evidence against $H_0$, not to prove that $H_0$ is true.\n",
    "- **Type I error** occurs when we incorrectly reject $H_0$ even though it is true (a false positive).\n",
    "- **Type II error** happens when we fail to reject $H_0$ even though $H_1$ is true (a false negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation of the P-value\n",
    "\n",
    "The **p-value** is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed, assuming that the null hypothesis $H_0$ is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **p-value** does not represent the probability that $H_0$ is true or false. It simply measures how consistent the data are with the null hypothesis.\n",
    "- A **large p-value** means the data are consistent with $H_0$, but this does not prove that $H_0$ is true.\n",
    "- A **small p-value** (when $p < \\alpha$) provides strong evidence against $H_0$, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis.\n",
    "- A **large p-value** (when $p \\geq \\alpha$) indicates insufficient evidence to reject $H_0$, so we fail to reject it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Coin Toss Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **null hypothesis ($H_0$)** states that the coin is fair, meaning the probability of heads is $P(\\text{heads}) = 0.5$.\n",
    "- The **alternative hypothesis ($H_1$)** suggests that the coin is not fair, so the probability of heads is $P(\\text{heads}) \\neq 0.5$.\n",
    "- The experiment involved a total of **10 tosses** ($n = 10$).\n",
    "- The **observed outcome** was 4 heads and 6 tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statistical Test\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the **binomial test** to calculate the p-value for the observed outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "I. **Compute the probability of observing exactly 4 heads** under $H_0$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(X = 4) = \\binom{10}{4} (0.5)^{4} (0.5)^{6} = \\frac{210 \\times 0.0625 \\times 0.015625}{1} = 0.2051\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "II. **Compute the probabilities for more extreme outcomes** (0 to 4 heads and 6 to 10 heads) since it's a two-tailed test.\n",
    "\n",
    "III. **Total P-value**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{p-value} = 2 \\times \\left( P(X \\leq 4) \\right) = 2 \\times \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{4} P(X = k) \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "IV. **Sum of Probabilities**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "P(X = 0) &= 0.00098 \\\\\n",
    "P(X = 1) &= 0.00977 \\\\\n",
    "P(X = 2) &= 0.04395 \\\\\n",
    "P(X = 3) &= 0.11719 \\\\\n",
    "P(X = 4) &= 0.20508 \\\\\n",
    "\\sum_{k=0}^{4} P(X = k) &= 0.37697\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "V. **Compute P-value**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{p-value} = 2 \\times 0.37697 = 0.75394\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **significance level ($\\alpha$)** is typically set at 0.05.\n",
    "- In this case, the **comparison** shows that the p-value is $0.75394$, which is greater than $0.05$.\n",
    "- As a result, we are **failing to reject $H_0$**, meaning we cannot conclude that the coin is unfair based on this data.\n",
    "- However, this does not mean we are **accepting $H_0$**. The result does not prove the coin is fair; it simply indicates that the observed data are consistent with a fair coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Statistical power** is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when $H_1$ is true.\n",
    "- The **sample size** influences power, with larger samples leading to increased power.\n",
    "- A **one-tailed test** checks for an effect in one specific direction, such as $P(\\text{heads}) > 0.5$.\n",
    "- A **two-tailed test** examines for an effect in either direction, for example, $P(\\text{heads}) \\neq 0.5$.\n",
    "- **Confidence intervals** provide an estimated range of values that are likely to include the population parameter.\n",
    "- In relation to **hypothesis testing**, if the confidence interval does not include the null hypothesis value, $H_0$ can be rejected.\n"
