    "## Poisson Distribution (Discrete)\n",
    "\n",
    "A discrete random variable X follows a Poisson distribution if the events occur independently and at a constant average rate. The Poisson distribution is denoted as $X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)$, where $\\lambda$ is the average rate (or mean) of events occurring in a given interval.\n",

    "### Probability Mass Function (PMF)\n",
    "\n",
    "The PMF of a Poisson distribution is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(X=k) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^k}{k!}$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The CDF of a Poisson distribution is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F(k) = P(X \\le k) = \\sum_{i=0}^{k} \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^i}{i!}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "The expected value (mean) and variance of a Poisson distribution are both equal to the average rate parameter $\\lambda$:\n",

    "$$M_X(t) = E[e^{tX}] = e^{\\lambda(e^t - 1)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the n-th moment, we take the n-th derivative of the MGF with respect to t and then evaluate it at t=0:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[X^n] = \\frac{d^n M_X(t)}{dt^n}\\Bigg|_{t=0}$$\n",

    "### Example: Hospital Emergency Room Visits\n",
    "\n",
    "A hospital's emergency room experiences an average of 5 visits per hour due to accidents. We can model this using a Poisson distribution.\n",

    "II. What is the probability of more than 7 accidents in an hour?\n",
    "\n",
    "For more than 7 accidents:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(X > 7) = 1 - \\sum_{k=0}^{7} \\frac{e^{-5} \\cdot 5^k}{k!} = 0.1339 $$\n",

    "\n",
    "If the number of trials in a binomial distribution is large (n) and the probability of success (p) is small, then the binomial distribution can be approximated by a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda = np$:\n",
