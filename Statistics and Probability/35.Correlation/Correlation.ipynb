    "# Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correlation** is a statistical measure that quantifies the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It is a fundamental concept in statistics, enabling researchers and analysts to understand how one variable may predict or relate to another. The most commonly used correlation coefficients are the **Pearson correlation coefficient** and the **Spearman rank correlation coefficient**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **positive correlation** occurs when, as one variable increases, the other tends to rise as well.\n",
    "- In contrast, a **negative correlation** happens when an increase in one variable results in the other decreasing.\n",
    "- Lastly, a **zero correlation** indicates that there is no linear relationship between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note**: Correlation does not imply causation. A high correlation between two variables does not mean that one variable causes changes in the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pearson Correlation Coefficient ($r$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Pearson correlation coefficient** measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables. It is sensitive to outliers and assumes that the relationship is linear and that both variables are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient $r$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\\sigma_X \\sigma_Y}\n",

    "\n",
    "- Variables can have a strong non-linear relationship but a low Pearson correlation coefficient.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Assumptions of Pearson's $r$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linearity** means that the relationship between $X$ and $Y$ is straight and follows a linear pattern.\n",
    "2. **Normality** refers to the condition where both $X$ and $Y$ are normally distributed.\n",
    "3. Lastly, **homoscedasticity** implies that the variance of $Y$ remains consistent across all values of $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If these assumptions are violated, Pearson's $r$ may not be an appropriate measure of correlation.\n"
