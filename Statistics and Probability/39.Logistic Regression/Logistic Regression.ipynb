    "# Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is a statistical method used for modeling the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables. It is widely used in various fields such as medicine, social sciences, and machine learning for classification problems where the dependent variable is dichotomous (e.g., success/failure, yes/no, positive/negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Logistic Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "In logistic regression, the dependent variable $y $ takes on binary values:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_i = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "1 & \\text{if event occurs (e.g., success)} \\\\\n",
    "0 & \\text{if event does not occur (e.g., failure)}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistic Function (Sigmoid Function)\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic function models the probability that $y = 1$ given the predictor variables $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_p $:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x) = P(y = 1 \\mid x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_p x_p)}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This function maps any real-valued number into a value between 0 and 1, making it suitable for probability estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Odds and Logit Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The **odds** of an event occurring is the ratio of the probability that the event occurs to the probability that it does not occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Odds}(x) = \\frac{p(x)}{1 - p(x)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The natural logarithm of the odds is called the **logit function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{logit}(p(x)) = \\ln \\left( \\frac{p(x)}{1 - p(x)} \\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_p x_p\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The logit function establishes a linear relationship between the predictor variables and the log-odds of the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation of Coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **intercept ($\\beta_0$)** represents the log-odds of the outcome when all predictor variables are zero.\n",
    "- The **coefficients ($\\beta_j$)** indicate the change in the log-odds of the outcome for a one-unit increase in $x_j$, while keeping all other variables constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exponentiating the coefficients provides the **odds ratios**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Odds Ratio for } x_j = e^{\\beta_j}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates that as $x_j $ increases, the odds of the outcome occurring increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Estimation of Coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike linear regression, logistic regression does not have a closed-form solution for estimating the coefficients. Instead, coefficients are estimated using **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Likelihood Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $n $ independent observations, the likelihood function $L(\\boldsymbol{\\beta})$ is the product of the probabilities of observing the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} [p(x_i)]^{y_i} [1 - p(x_i)]^{1 - y_i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Log-Likelihood Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the natural logarithm simplifies the product into a sum:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\ell(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = \\ln L(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left[ y_i \\ln p(x_i) + (1 - y_i) \\ln (1 - p(x_i)) \\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maximizing the Log-Likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to find the coefficients $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ that maximize $\\ell(\\boldsymbol{\\beta})$. This is typically done using iterative numerical methods such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Newton-Raphson method\n",
    "- Fisher Scoring\n",
    "- Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "### Newton-Raphson Method\n",
    "\n",
    "An iterative method that updates the coefficient estimates using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k+1)} = \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k)} - [\\mathbf{H}(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k)})]^{-1} \\mathbf{g}(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k)})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{g}(\\boldsymbol{\\beta})$ is the gradient (first derivative) of the log-likelihood function.\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{H}(\\boldsymbol{\\beta})$ is the Hessian matrix (second derivative) of the log-likelihood function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions of Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **binary outcome** indicates that the dependent variable has two possible values.\n",
    "2. **Independent observations** ensure that each data point is independent of the others.\n",
    "3. **Linearity in log-odds** means that the logit of the outcome is a linear function of the predictor variables.\n",
    "4. **No multicollinearity** ensures that the predictor variables are not highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "5. A **large sample size** is preferred, as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) performs better with more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
