    "Probability theory is based on a set of principles, or axioms, that define the properties of the probability measure. These axioms, first formalized by the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov, are the foundation upon which the entire framework of probability is built.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Three Axioms\n",
    "\n",
    "I. **Non-negativity** states that the probability of any event A is a non-negative number. This reflects the idea that an event either happens or it doesn't, and thus, the probability cannot be negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A) \\geq 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "II. **Unit Measure** ensures that the probability of the sample space S, which includes all possible outcomes of an experiment, is always equal to 1. This is equivalent to saying that it's certain at least one of the possible outcomes will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(S) = 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "III. The axiom of **additivity** is about disjoint events, also known as mutually exclusive events. If events A and B cannot both occur at the same time, the probability of either event A or event B occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) \\ \\text{if} \\ A \\cap B = \\emptyset\n",

    "Let's expand the example of rolling a fair six-sided die with more rigor, detailing the probability calculations and clarifying how to apply the rules of probability step-by-step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Probabilities of Events in a Dice Roll\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll examine various probability calculations based on outcomes when rolling a fair six-sided die. The sample space for a single roll of a six-sided die is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each face of the die is equally likely to occur, so the probability of any single outcome is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{any specific number}) = \\frac{1}{6}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Probability of Rolling a 5 or 6\n",
    "\n",
    "- The events \"rolling a 5\" and \"rolling a 6\" are **mutually exclusive**, meaning they cannot happen at the same time (you can't roll both 5 and 6 on a single die roll).\n",
    "- To find the probability of either event occurring, we use the addition rule for mutually exclusive events:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(5 \\text{ or } 6) = P(5) + P(6)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(5) = \\frac{1}{6}, \\quad P(6) = \\frac{1}{6}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(5 \\text{ or } 6) = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the probability of rolling either a 5 or a 6 is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Probability of Rolling an Even or Odd Number\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every number on a die is either even or odd, and no number can be both. These events are **mutually exclusive**, but together they cover the entire sample space $S$.\n",
    "- The possible even numbers are $\\{2, 4, 6\\}$, and the possible odd numbers are $\\{1, 3, 5\\}$. Since the entire sample space is covered by these two groups, the probability of rolling either an even or an odd number is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{even} \\text{ or } \\text{odd}) = P(S) = 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes sense intuitively because the outcome will always be either even or odd on a six-sided die.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Probability of Rolling an Even Number or a 3\n",
    "\n",
    "- The events \"rolling an even number\" and \"rolling a 3\" are **mutually exclusive** because 3 is not an even number. \n",
    "- The possible even numbers are $\\{2, 4, 6\\}$, so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{even}) = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(3) = \\frac{1}{6}\n",

    "\n",
    "To add these fractions, we convert to a common denominator:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{6}\n",

    "\n",
    "Therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 4. Probability of Rolling an Even Number or a 4\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the events \"rolling an even number\" and \"rolling a 4\" are **not mutually exclusive** because 4 is an even number. Therefore, if we simply added the probabilities of both events, we would count the outcome of rolling a 4 twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, calculate the probability of rolling an even number (as above):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{even}) = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, calculate the probability of rolling a 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(4) = \\frac{1}{6}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since 4 is already included in the set of even numbers, we subtract the overlap to avoid double-counting. The overlap is the probability of rolling a 4, which is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{even} \\text{ and } 4) = P(4) = \\frac{1}{6}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, applying the general addition rule for events that are **not mutually exclusive**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{even} \\text{ or } 4) = P(\\text{even}) + P(4) - P(\\text{even} \\text{ and } 4)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting the values:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{even} \\text{ or } 4) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{6}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplifying:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{even} \\text{ or } 4) = \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{6}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We are tasked with calculating the probability of drawing a card that is either a heart or a queen. This is an example where the events are **not mutually exclusive**, as one card (the queen of hearts) belongs to both categories.\n",

    "\n",
    "I. **Calculate $P(\\text{Heart})$**:\n",
