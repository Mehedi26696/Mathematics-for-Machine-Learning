    "## Forecasting with Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series forecasting is a technique used to predict future values based on historical data. It is widely used in various fields, such as finance, economics, and meteorology. In this section, we will discuss the basics of time series forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of a Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "A time series can be decomposed into four main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "I. **Trend** represents the long-term progression of the series, signifying a persistent, general direction of the data over a long period. It can be upward, downward, or even a stable trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"f1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "II. **Seasonality** are patterns that repeat at regular intervals, like daily, monthly, or quarterly. This component reflects the influence of seasonal factors on the time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"f2.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "III. Unlike seasonality, **cyclical** patterns occur at less regular intervals. These fluctuations are often linked to economic, political, or even environmental factors and can span multiple years.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"f3.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "IV. **Random (or Irregular)** component captures the 'noise' or random variation in the data. It represents the unpredictable, erratic factors affecting the time series after the trend, seasonality, and cyclical components have been accounted for.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"f4.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forecasting Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various methods for time series forecasting, each suited to specific scenarios and data characteristics. Here are some commonly used methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Naive Forecast\n",
    "\n",
    "This method assumes that the next value in the time series will be equal to the most recent value.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `y` is the time series and `t` is an index to time, the naive forecast for time `t+1` is simply the value at time `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{y}_{t+1} = y_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES)** is a method used for forecasting univariate time series data without a trend or seasonal component. Unlike methods that weight each past observation equally, SES assigns exponentially decreasing weights to past observations, giving more importance to recent data. The method is especially suitable for data that follows a pattern that is approximately flat with noise around a constant level.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for SES is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{x}_{t+1} = \\alpha x_t + (1 - \\alpha) \\hat{x}_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\hat{x}_{t+1}$ is the forecast for the next time period.\n",
    "- $x_t$ is the actual observation at time $t$.\n",
    "- $\\hat{x}_t$ is the forecast for time $t$ made at time $t-1$.\n",
    "- $\\alpha$ is the smoothing parameter, $0 < \\alpha \\leq 1$, which determines the rate of smoothing. A higher $\\alpha$ gives more weight to recent observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "SES can be thought of as a weighted average of past observations, where the weights decrease exponentially as we move further into the past. This means that more recent observations are weighted more heavily than older ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for any time $t$, we can recursively substitute the previous forecasts:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{x}_{t+1} = \\alpha x_t + (1 - \\alpha)\\left[\\alpha x_{t-1} + (1 - \\alpha)\\hat{x}_{t-1}\\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Expanding this equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{x}_{t+1} = \\alpha x_t + \\alpha(1 - \\alpha) x_{t-1} + \\alpha(1 - \\alpha)^2 x_{t-2} + \\ldots\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows that the forecast is a weighted average of all previous observations, with the weights decreasing exponentially at the rate $1 - \\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of the weights converges to 1, ensuring the method remains stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Initial Condition\n",
    "\n",
    "To initialize the process, we need a starting point for the forecast, $\\hat{x}_1$. One common approach is to set the initial forecast equal to the first data point:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{x}_1 = x_1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we can use the average of the first few data points as the initial value.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Forecast Error\n",
    "\n",
    "The forecast error at any time $t$ is the difference between the actual observation and the forecast made at time $t-1$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "e_t = x_t - \\hat{x}_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of SES is to minimize the sum of squared errors over time. We can use this to find the optimal value of $\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)** is a measure of the total error in the model, which we aim to minimize when choosing the best smoothing parameter $\\alpha$. The SSE is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "SSE(\\alpha) = \\sum_{t=1}^{n} (x_t - \\hat{x}_t)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For different values of $\\alpha$, we compute the SSE and select the $\\alpha$ that minimizes this sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Choosing the Optimal Smoothing Parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of $\\alpha$ determines how much weight we give to recent observations versus older ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If $\\alpha$ is close to 1**, most of the weight is placed on the most recent observation, making the method highly reactive to new data and suitable for rapidly changing time series.\n",
    "- **If $\\alpha$ is close to 0**, the forecast gives more weight to older observations, making the method less sensitive to recent fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, $\\alpha$ is usually chosen by minimizing the SSE using a grid search or another optimization technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Recursive Form of SES\n",
    "\n",
    "SES is often expressed in a **recursive form**, which is computationally efficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{x}_{t+1} = \\alpha x_t + (1 - \\alpha) \\hat{x}_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This recursive equation updates the forecast at time $t+1$ based on the observed value at time $t$ and the forecast made for time $t$. It requires minimal computational resources and is easy to implement programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Holt’s Linear Trend Method (Double Exponential Smoothing)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Holt’s Linear Trend Model** extends SES to handle data with a linear trend. It introduces a second smoothing equation to account for the trend in the time series.\n",
    "- The method smooths both the level and the trend of the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Holt's model has two equations: one for the level and one for the trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Level equation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\ell_t = \\alpha x_t + (1 - \\alpha)(\\ell_{t-1} + b_{t-1})\n",

    "\n",
    "- $\\beta$ is the smoothing parameter for the trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forecast equation**:\n",
    "\n",

    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\hat{x}_{t+h}$ is the forecast $h$ periods ahead,\n",
    "- $h$ is the forecast horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The initial level ($\\ell_1$) is typically set as the first observation $x_1$.\n",
    "- The initial trend ($b_1$) can be estimated as the difference between the first two observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "b_1 = x_2 - x_1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Holt’s method **captures trends** effectively and is ideal for time series with a constant linear trend.\n",
    "- There are **two smoothing parameters** in Holt’s method: $\\alpha$ for controlling level smoothing and $\\beta$ for controlling trend smoothing.\n",
    "- In **sales forecasting**, companies use Holt’s method to predict sales data that follows a linear growth or decline over time.\n",
    "- For **revenue prediction**, Holt’s method is useful for forecasting revenue in businesses experiencing steady growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Holt-Winters Seasonal Method (Triple Exponential Smoothing)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Holt-Winters method** extends Holt’s Linear Trend Model by introducing a third equation to model the seasonal component in the time series, making it suitable for data with seasonality.\n",
    "- With the **Holt-Winters method**, you can handle time series data that exhibits both trend and seasonality, making it a powerful tool for more complex forecasting scenarios.\n",
    "- An **additive model** is used when the seasonal variation in the time series remains roughly constant over time.\n",
    "- A **multiplicative model** is appropriate when the seasonal variation increases or decreases proportionally with the level of the series.\n",

    "### Machine Learning for Time Series Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning (ML) has become increasingly popular for time series forecasting, especially as data grows more complex and requires non-linear methods. Traditional statistical approaches like ARIMA work well for simpler datasets, but machine learning can handle complex patterns, high-dimensionality, and non-linear relationships better. In this overview, we'll cover key machine learning models used for time series forecasting, with detailed explanations of each approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Challenges in Time Series Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning algorithms for time series forecasting face several challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **temporal dependency** in time series data indicates that current values depend on past values, so the data cannot be treated as independent observations.\n",
    "- **Stationarity** is often assumed in many models, meaning the statistical properties of the time series, like mean and variance, remain constant over time.\n",
    "- Time series frequently exhibit **seasonality and trends**, with recurring seasonal patterns or trends that need to be effectively modeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these challenges, various machine learning models and techniques can be employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Supervised Learning Approach for Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **supervised learning framework** for time series forecasting, we aim to transform the time series problem into a regression task where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input features** (X) are the lagged values (past observations),\n",
    "- **Target variable** (Y) is the future value we want to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to predict the value at time $t$, the features might be the values at times $t-1, t-2, \\ldots, t-n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Data Preparation (Feature Engineering for Time Series)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **lag features** are essential in time series analysis and include past values of the time series. Example: To predict the value of $y_t$, we can use past values like $y_{t-1}, y_{t-2}, \\ldots$ as input features.\n",
    "2. **Windowed features** summarize past values over a specific window, such as calculating the mean, variance, or sum over the last 7 days.\n",
    "3. **Time-based features** include details like month, year, weekday, and hour, helping capture seasonality or periodic trends.\n",
    "4. Using **rolling/aggregated statistics**, such as moving averages or rolling sums, provides useful features by aggregating data over time windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Machine Learning Models for Time Series Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "- Models like **decision trees** split data based on conditions, creating a tree-like structure where each split aims to minimize error for the target variable, such as predicting the future value of a time series.\n",
    "- A **random forest** is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees, each trained on different data subsets, and averages their results to improve robustness and reduce overfitting.\n",
    "- In the approach of **time series as a supervised learning problem**, lagged values (past observations) are used as features to predict the next value, with the model learning the relationships between past lags and the future outcome.\n",
    "- One of the **advantages** of this method is that it handles non-linear relationships, is robust to outliers, and can model interactions between lagged variables.\n",
    "- However, its **disadvantages** include not directly modeling temporal dependencies and lacking the ability to handle autoregressive forecasting natively.\n",
    "\n",

    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\n",

    "- **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, and **CatBoost** are advanced implementations of gradient boosting, each optimized for speed and performance.\n",
    "- Like Random Forests, lagged values and windowed features are used to predict future values. However, Gradient Boosting models tend to perform better than Random Forests on many time series tasks because they can better model complex relationships between features.\n",

However, it can give very high values when actual values are close to zero.                     |\n",
    "| **Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (sMAPE)**| A variation of MAPE that accounts for symmetry in the error measurement, avoiding the issue of dividing by small actual values.                                                  | $sMAPE = \\frac{100}{n} \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\frac{\\lvert y_t - \\hat{y}_t \\rvert}{\\frac{\\lvert y_t \\rvert + \\lvert \\hat{y}_t \\rvert}{2}}$ | sMAPE resolves the issue of division by zero in MAPE by averaging the actual and predicted values, giving a more balanced perspective on prediction errors, especially in time series forecasting.                |\n",
    "| **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)**| Used for model selection, the AIC balances the goodness-of-fit of the model with its complexity. Lower AIC values indicate better models, but it penalizes models with more parameters.| $AIC = 2k - 2\\ln(L)$                                                                            | AIC helps to compare models, taking both the fit and complexity into account, favoring models that explain the data well without overfitting.                                                                  |\n",
    "| **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)**| Similar to AIC but includes a stronger penalty for models with more parameters, making it more suitable when the number of data points is small.                                      | $BIC = k \\ln(n) - 2 \\ln(L)$                                                                      | BIC penalizes model complexity more than AIC, making it more conservative and often more appropriate when working with smaller datasets.                                                                        |\n",
