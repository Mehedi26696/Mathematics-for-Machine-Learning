    "# Chi-Square Tests and Categorical Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The **chi-square ($\\chi^2$) test** is a statistical method used to determine if there is a significant difference between expected and observed frequencies in one or more categories. It helps assess whether any observed deviations could be due to chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Chi-Square Tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **goodness-of-fit test** determines whether an observed frequency distribution aligns with an expected distribution.\n",
    "2. The **test of homogeneity** assesses if different populations share the same distribution of a single categorical variable.\n",
    "3. The **test of independence** evaluates whether two categorical variables are independent within a single population.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Categorical Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Categorical data** involves variables that represent groupings or categories rather than numerical values. These categories are usually qualitative and can be nominal (no inherent order) or ordinal (with a logical order). Each data point falls into one and only one category.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An **example** would be the survival status of passengers on the Titanic, categorized by ticket class.\n",
    "- The **survival status** could be classified as \"Survived\" or \"Died.\"\n",
    "- The **ticket class** includes categories such as First, Second, Third, and Crew.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contingency Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "A **contingency table** (also known as a cross-tabulation or crosstab) is a matrix used to display the frequency distribution of variables. It allows us to analyze the relationship between two or more categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: The Titanic survival data organized into a 2×4 contingency table:\n",
    "\n",
    "|               | First Class | Second Class | Third Class | Crew | **Total** |\n",
    "|---------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|------|-----------|\n",
    "| **Survived**  |      a      |       b      |      c      |  d   |     S     |\n",
    "| **Died**      |      e      |       f      |      g      |  h   |     D     |\n",
    "| **Total**     |     325     |      285     |     706     | 885  |   2,201   |\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $a$ to $h$ represent the observed counts in each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Testing Goodness-of-Fit\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **null hypothesis ($H_0$)** states that the observed frequencies match the expected frequencies, indicating no significant difference between the observed and expected distributions.\n",
    "- The **alternative hypothesis ($H_A$)** claims that the observed frequencies do not match the expected frequencies.\n",

    "4. The data used should involve **categorical variables**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Application Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State the hypotheses** by defining $H_0$ and $H_A$.\n",
    "2. **Collect data** and organize observed frequencies into a contingency table.\n",
    "3. **Calculate expected counts** using the appropriate formulas based on the test.\n",
    "4. **Compute the chi-square statistic** by applying the chi-square formula.\n",
    "5. **Determine degrees of freedom** based on the dimensions of the table.\n",
    "6. **Find the critical value or p-value** using chi-square distribution tables or statistical software.\n",
    "7. **Make a decision** by comparing $\\chi^2_{\\text{calculated}}$ with $\\chi^2_{\\text{critical}}$.\n",
