    "## Introduction to Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "A distribution is a function that describes the probability of a random variable. It helps to understand the underlying patterns and characteristics of a dataset. Distributions are widely used in statistics, data analysis, and machine learning for tasks such as hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Random variables assign numerical values to outcomes of random processes in probability and statistics. Random variables can be **discrete** (taking specific values) or **continuous** (taking any value within a range).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Drawing a Card from a Deck\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Suit of the Card (Discrete)**: Assigns a category based on the suit (e.g., hearts, spades).\n",
    "- **Rank of the Card (Discrete)**: Numerical value or face (e.g., 2, 10, King).\n",
    "- **Color of the Card (Discrete)**: Red or Black.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Weather Forecast\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Temperature (Continuous)**: The forecasted temperature in degrees.\n",
    "- **Chance of Precipitation (Continuous)**: Probability of rain or snow, expressed in percentage.\n",
    "- **Wind Speed (Continuous)**: Speed of the wind in kilometers or miles per hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Discrete Example (Card Drawing)**: If X represents the suit of a card, $P(X = Hearts)$ is the probability of drawing a heart.\n",
    "- **Continuous Example (Temperature)**: If Y represents temperature, $P(Y > 20°C)$ is the chance that the temperature is above 20 degrees Celsius.\n",
    "- **General Probability Notations**: Calculate probabilities like $P(X < x), P(X ≤ x), P(X > x), P(X ≥ x)$, where 'x' is a specific value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Probability Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Probability Distribution**: A mathematical description of the likelihood of different outcomes in an experiment or process.\n",
    "- **Discrete Probability Distributions**: Used for discrete variables (e.g., counting outcomes like the number of heads in coin flips).\n",
    "- **Continuous Probability Distributions**: Used for continuous variables (e.g., measurements like height or weight).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Higher Probability Values**: The value 4 has the highest probability (0.20), suggesting that it is the most likely outcome.\n",
    "- **Comparing Probabilities**: The probability of getting a 4 is higher than getting a 10, as indicated by their respective probabilities (0.20 vs. 0.05).\n",
    "- **Sum of Probabilities**: The sum of all these probabilities equals 1, confirming that the table represents a complete probability distribution.\n",
