    "## Negative Binomial Distribution (Discrete)\n",
    "\n",
    "A discrete random variable X follows a negative binomial distribution if it represents the number of trials required to achieve a specified number of successes in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials. The negative binomial distribution is often denoted as $X \\sim \\text{NegBinomial}(r, p)$, where r is the number of successes required and p is the probability of success on each trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability Mass Function (PMF)\n",
    "\n",
    "The PMF of a negative binomial distribution is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(X=k) = \\binom{k-1}{r-1} p^r (1-p)^{k-r}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k \\in \\{r, r+1, r+2, \\dots\\}$ and $\\binom{k-1}{r-1}$ is the binomial coefficient.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF of a negative binomial distribution is not as straightforward to express in a closed form but is the sum of its PMF values:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F(k) = P(X \\le k) = \\sum_{i=r}^{k} \\binom{i-1}{r-1} p^r (1-p)^{i-r}$$\n",

    "### Expected Value and Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected value (mean) of a negative binomial distribution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[X] = \\frac{r}{p}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance of a negative binomial distribution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Var}(X) = \\frac{r(1-p)}{p^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Moment Generating Function (MGF)\n",
    "\n",
    "The moment generating function (MGF) of a negative binomial distribution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$M_X(t) = \\left(\\frac{pe^t}{1 - (1 - p)e^t}\\right)^r$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Quality Control Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "In quality control testing, an inspector examines products until finding a certain number of defective items. Suppose the probability of a product being defective is 0.1, and the inspector continues testing until 5 defective products are found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Probability of defective product `p = 0.1`\n",
    "- Number of defects required `r = 5`\n",
    "\n",
    "I. What is the probability that exactly 20 products need to be tested?\n",
    "\n",
    "For exactly 20 products tested:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(X = 20) = \\binom{19}{4} (0.1)^5 (0.9)^{15} â‰ˆ 0.031$$\n",
    "\n",
    "II. What is the expected number of products to be tested?\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected number of products tested:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[X] = \\frac{5}{0.1} = 50$$\n",
    "\n",
    "III. What is the variance in the number of products tested?\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance in the number of products tested:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Var}(X) = \\frac{5 \\times (1-0.1)}{0.1^2} = 450$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative binomial distributions are commonly used in scenarios where the number of trials until a specified number of failures occurs is of interest, such as in reliability testing, epidemiology, and ecological studies.\n"
